You can select geometry in an assembly part file or any component part file to use in an operation. If the selected geometry is located in the component part file, the CAM operation will contain an occurrence of the selected geometry. All selected geometry is associative (See Associativity).\\nCAM objects (Operations, Tools) can only be retrieved in the assembly part file. You can retrieve libraries of tools or a component library part file. Part merge can be used to retrieve CAM objects from the component part into the assembly part.\\nAn assembly can be created containing components, such as clamps and fixtures. This approach:\\nAvoids having to merge clamp, fixture, etc. geometry into the part to be machined.\\nAllows you to generate fully associative tool paths for models that you may not have write access privilege.\\nEnables multiple NC programmers to develop NC data in separate files simultaneously.\\nThe Manufacturing application retains the information used in generating a tool path. This capability is termed associativity.\\nNote:\\nIf you are in a Teamcenter environment, or if your configuration includes LIBRARY_SETUP_TEMPLATE, such as cam_library, then the assembly can be created automatically by selecting the appropriate setup. This setup can contain CAM objects, as well as geometry and components, such as clamps. Your work part is placed in this assembly. See Data Management for more information.\\nOperation Navigator\\nThe Operation Navigator is a graphical organization aid with a tree structure that illustrates relationships between the geometry, machining method, and tool parameter groups and the operations within a program. Parameters are passed down or inherited from group to group and from group to operation based on their location in the tree structure. You can view and manage relationships between operations and parameter groups to share the parameters among operations.\\nExcept for a few cases, you can determine whether or not to apply inheritance.\\nOperation\\nAn operation contains all information used to generate a single tool path.\\nAssociativity\\nIf the geometry or tool used for an operation is edited after generating its tool path, the operation automatically uses the new information when you regenerate. It is not necessary to re–select the geometry. If geometry required to generate the tool path is deleted, the software prompts you to specify new geometry.\\nAutomatically updating tool paths every time geometry is altered can reduce productivity, since some operations can take many minutes to complete. Therefore, it is up to you to update the tool paths when necessary. Similarly, when you specify a clearance line in Turning, the coordinate data is saved, but modification of the line is not reflected in the operations.\\nMCS\\nThere are two coordinate systems which are unique to Manufacturing: the Machine Coordinate System and the Reference Coordinate System.\\nThe Machine Coordinate System is the base location for all subsequent tool path output points. This allows you to move the Work Coordinate System (WCS) independently. If you move the MCS, you re-establish the base location for the subsequent tool path output points.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/opt_avail_temp', 'document_title': 'NX Manufacturing templates', 'document_body': 'Templates contain pre-set options and dialog box layouts that are customized for specific tasks.

The setup can be in the same file as the part you are cutting, or in a separate assembly file.\\nConsists of all operations, their resulting tool paths, and the environment in which the operations are created. This includes programs and parameters for tooling, geometry and cutting methods.\\nPromotes standardization as it can be saved as a template and reused.\\nThe setup starts with a part model. The requirements vary with part complexity:\\nSimple parts may not need additional geometry for programming purposes.\\nYou can add a setup to the part file to create a simple setup file. (non-assembly)\\nMore complex parts may need a fixture to add clarification.\\nCreate a setup assembly file that references the geometry to machine as a component. This is the recommended approach, and lets you add the blank, clamps, tooling, or other components as needed.\\nVery complex parts may need machine tools and NX Machine Tool Simulation (NX MTS) as part of the setup. You may need to stop for inspections, heat treatments or other non-machining steps, to rotate the part to machine a different side, or move the part to a different machine.\\nIf necessary, you can create multiple setups for the different machining conditions.\\nSimple setup assembly\\nModerately complex setup assembly\\nComplex setup assembly'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_setup_init_setup', 'document_title': 'Initializing the CAM setup', 'document_body': 'How you create the CAM setup depends on whether you are in a native NX or Teamcenter environment.\\nIn native NX, there are several ways to create the CAM setup for your part:\\nOpen the part to machine, then let the software create the setup assembly.

If you want to use a different tool for the pre-roughing, display the Tool View and move that operation to a new tool.\\nTo generate the tool paths without examining the operations first, select the Generate Tool Paths checkbox and click OK.\\nGenerate.\\nAdditional Sequences\\nYou have now created one machining sequence for some or all of the workpiece. If needed, you can create more sequences for other cut areas on this workpiece, or for another workpiece.\\nCustomizing\\nThe process assistant is an aid to help you create a setup and the sequences of operations. Once you use the process assistant you can edit these operations to fit them to your needs. You can also delete or add operations to change the process.\\nIf you are making the same edits and changes to the same operations after using the process assistant, you should consider customizing the operations in the template, or creating your own template. Remember that these templates are updated with each release, so make a copy of your customization.\"}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/d035bea7aa17ba8f0210fa492a56339c', 'document_title': 'NX Machine Powered Programming', 'document_body': \"Machine Powered Programming allows you to seamlessly incorporate machine capabilities into the CAM process, so you can consider machine abilities and constraints at the start of the engineering workflow.\\nThis integration promotes efficient and more accurate programming experience, giving you continuous access to machine capabilities without requiring additional settings or redundant information.\\nThe machine\\nYou can use Machine Powered Programming capabilities in the NX Manufacturing application only when your machine kinematics are enabled with Machine Powered Programming. Machines are available on Post Hub or you can build one using the Machine Kit Wizard dialog box in the Machine Tool Builder application with the help of available templates.\\nUsing a machine enabled with Machine Powered Programming in NX Manufacturing improves the user interface and changes user experience regarding the tool handling and machine interactions during CAM programming.\\nNote:\\nCurrently, NX Machine Powered Programming is available only for a milling machine that includes a single channel and a single kinematic chain.\\nMachine Kinematics\\nTo use machine kinematics enabled for Machine Powered Programming, you must define some additional parameters. You can see those parameters in the Create Machine Component/Edit Machine Component dialog box in the Classify Component group.\\nInstant machine preview with Display Tool in Machine option\\nUse the Display Tool in Machine in the Ribbon bar to activate an instant machine preview at any time during tool path creation or editing, and outside in combination with Tool Path Animation or Select Tool Path. Display Tool in Machine is available in CAM setups exclusively with a Machine Powered Programming enabled machine kit.\\nThe option is meant to help you create tool paths more quickly and improve quality. You should use the machine preview with Display Tool in Machine to get a quick visual impression of the current machining situation. However, to ensure a collision-free and optimal machining process, it is recommended to use the machine code-based simulation as a final check.\\nInstant machine preview with Display Tool in Machine option during operation edit\\nTo use the Display Tool in Machine option during the operation edit, go to Manufacturing Preference - Operations Tab on the Operations tab, and in the Edit Operation group, you can select the Allow Display Tool in Machine option.\\nWhen you set this preference, the Display Tool in Machine button is displayed, allowing visualization of the tool with the machine during editing. This gives you an animated preview of the machine's interaction with the tool paths.\\nThe Display Tool in Machine option is turned off when you open an edit operation dialog box. Then the view switches to the stationary part. When you leave the operation edit dialog box, the Display Tool in Machine option is again available.\\nOperation Navigator Machine Tool View\\nWhen you use a machine kit that is enabled with Machine Powered Programming in a CAM setup, that changes the scope for the Machine Tool View in the Operation Navigator. To specify the machining view of the tool, you assign the tool to the carrier location where it is used during the machining process. Pockets are not available and tools can be assigned to an available carrier or carriers, or to Unused Items. You cannot place tools outside of a carrier or in Unused Items.\\nTo adjust a Tool Number, Adjust Register, or Cutcom Register value, you must change it manually in the tool edit dialog box. This ensures that when you create a new tool, the tool number is unique.\\nNote:\\nThis Machine Tool View is available only for setups that use Machine Powered Programming enabled machine kits.\\nCaveats\\nRetrieve Machine or Device from Library\\nAdditional devices like chucks or vices retrieved from the NX CAM device library are not supported with Machine Powered Programming capabilities. To use such devices, you must add them as assembly components to the CAM setup, or build them directly into the machine kinematics mode.\\nMixtures of machines or devices with or without the Machine Powered Programming option are prohibited. NX displays a warning.\\nExample:\\nBefore replacing an old machine with a new machine, make sure that no geometry is assigned in the Kinematic Model setup elements, that is, in Setup configurator. Part, blank, or fixture geometry should be assigned via the Physical Workpiece option in the Workpiece Geometry dialog box.\\nNavigator Bar – Setup Configurator\\nThe Machine Tool Navigator - Setup Configurator is not supported with Machine Powered Programming enabled machines.\\nSimulate Machine – Tool Path Based\\nManufacturing setups using Machine Powered Programming machines cannot use the Tool Path Based Simulation option from the Simulate Machine command.\\nVerify Tool Path\\nIt is not recommended to use the Verify Tool Path command in conjunction with the Display Tool in Machine option. A correct machine preview cannot be guaranteed.\\nTool Display Options\\nTool Display settings are not applied when you use Display Tool in Machine.\\nDynamic Tool Display\\nWhen you dynamically move the spindle, this can interfere with the active Display Tool in Machine and lead to unwanted machine preview behavior. We recommend that you turn off Display Tool in Machine when dynamic tool display dialog boxes are open.\\nTool Path Animation with solid assembly tools in conjunction with Display Tool in Machine\\nNo tool is displayed on the spindle when the part files of the solid tools are not loaded. That is, a part file is not stored on the machine.\\nAsymmetric Tools - such as Back Counter Sinking\\nTool paths with asymmetric tools that require a spindle position, such as back counter sinks, are not supported and will result in an incorrect tool position when Display Tool in Machine is active.\"}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_setup_op', 'document_title': 'Manufacturing operations', 'document_body': 'An operation:\\nGenerates one tool path.\\nContains the information required to generate the tool path: geometry, tool, and machining parameters.\\nFor each operation that you generate and accept, the software saves the information used to generate the tool path in the current part.

For example, if are trying to reduce tool changes you can either choose to change the order of the operations, or change the tool that the operation uses. Changing the order of the operations is most easily done in the Program Order View. Changing the tool the operation uses is most easily done in the Tool View. This is because the Program Order View groups the operations together in chronological order and the Tool View groups the operations by the tool.\\nNote:\\nThe Program Order view will always be synchronized when moving operations in the other views of the Operation Navigator.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_setup_using_geom', 'document_title': 'Using Geometry View to Enhance Your NC Programs', 'document_body': 'If you want to plan your NC program based on geometry, use the Geometry View instead of the Program Order View. You can then organize the setup by geometric feature.\\nFor example, you can create a geometry group for Pocket A that includes a rough mill operation and a finish mill operation. You do the same for Pocket B. In the Program Order View, you change the order of the operation so that you rough both pockets first then finish both pockets. In the Geometry View your operations are organized by the geometry they machine, but in the Program Order View, those same operations are organized in the order they are output.\\nIf you create your NC program in the Program Order View, you can still use the Geometry View to help you edit the NC program. Use the Geometry View to evaluate the operations used in each geometry group and decide if the arrangement is the most efficient. Since the Geometry View groups the operations together according to their geometry group, the Geometry View can be used to easily move or copy an operation from one geometry group to another.\\nAlways check how the changes you have made in any view affect the Program Order View, as this is the view that contains the sequence of the operations for output.\\nOperation Order\\nThe order of the operations within the geometry groups is linked from the Geometry View to the Program Order View. If you change the order of operations within a geometry group in the Geometry View, those changes are also reflected in the Program Order View.  \\nFor example, if a hole_geom group contains center drill, drill, and tap, those three operations must occur in that order at each hole. Other operations in other geometry groups can occur in between, but for any hole in the group, center drill must precede drill which must precede the tap.\\nFor reordering to occur in the program group and be maintained in the Program Order View, the operations:\\nMust be in the same geometry group\\nMust be in the same program group\\nMust appear in sequential order\\nIf there are operations from different programs between your ordered operations, then the order will not be maintained in the Program Order View. For example, if there are three operations in one geometry group, but the third operation is in a different program, and operation 1 is moved to a position after operation 2, the order will be updated in the program view. However, if operation 1 is moved to after operation 3, the order in the Program Order View will not be updated, because operation 3 is in a different program.\\nThe relative order of consecutive operations within a geometry group is maintained in the Program Order View, the order of the geometry groups in the Geometry View is not.  In other words, the order of operations in different geometry groups is not automatically maintained in the Program Order View.\\nThe Tool and Method Views have no effect on the Program Order View.\\nOperations in the Unused Items group are not considered when determining the order between the Geometry and the Program Order Views.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_using_tool_view', 'document_title': 'Using the Tool View to Enhance Your NC Program', 'document_body': 'When you have viewed the Tool View and seen all the operations in which the tools are used, you can analyze the situation and decide if it is arranged in the most efficient way. Use this view to change the tool the operation uses, by moving the operation to a different tool parent. Since the Tool View groups the operations together by tool name, it allows you to quickly locate the tool you are searching for. Therefore, making changes in your operation relating to the tool are most easily performed in the Tool View. For example if you modified a tool, you would use the Tool View to see all of the operations that used that tool, and regenerate them to update their tool paths.\\nThe graphic below is an example of the Tool View. In the furthest left hand column, under Name, you can see all the tools that are in the part. You can also see that only two of these tools are actually used by operations. You can tell this by the plus or minus sign that is to the left of the tool name.\\nIn this example Tool UGTI0203_013 has been expanded to show the operation in which it is used. If you decide you want tool UGT0203_008 to perform this operation (FLOWCUT_SINGLE) you can drag and drop the operation into the correct place. Select the operation and drag it to the tool you want to use in that operation. Let go of the mouse, and that tool is now used in that operation.\\nAfter moving an operation, status is set to regenerate, so you need to regenerate the operation to update the tool path.\\nTool UGTI0203_017 is collapsed.

In addition, you can optionally check for collisions with the tool holder. When gouges are found, the software displays them in a color of your choice. If you activate the Pause option, NX displays a motion range dialog indicating the gouge detections. The software stops at any subsequent gouge detection to indicate the range. If turned off, the system continues to process and display all gouges until the End-of-Path is reached. A report is written to the standard NX Information window listing the number of gouges detected.\\nTip:\\nTo see a report containing information about individual gouges, use the Gouge Check option.\\nThe gouge check is faster when the tool axis is aligned, in either the positive or negative direction, along the main X, Y, or Z axis. Rotating the tool axis or the MCS increases the calculation time.\\nNote:\\nIf you want the software to automatically gouge check an operation before postprocessing, you can activate the Gouge check before Postprocessing option in the Manufacturing → Output → Postprocessing section of the customer defaults.\\nThe following table explains how certain parameters affect gouge checking. There is no user interface for these values, since they are taken from the operation being gouge checked.\\nSafe Clearance\\nWhen checking for holder collisions, the software takes this value from the operation. It defines the minimum distance the tool holder should stay away from the material.\\nIntol/Outtol\\nChanging the Intol or Outtol values of an operation alters the tolerance for gouging motions. NX uses the following formula to calculate a threshold value from the specified Intol/Outtol:\\n2*(Intol+(Intol+Outtol)/2)\\nNX compares the depth of each gouge against the threshold value, then reports all gouges that are greater than the threshold value.\\nPart Offset and/or Part Stock\\nThe cutters diameter is virtually enlarged by the sum of this value. If the real tool comes closer to the part than this value, the internal virtual tool intersects the part and a gouge is reported.\\nTransforming\\nTransforming or editing the path does not change the stock or tolerance values. If you transform a correct tool path to go right through the part geometry, gouges are found.\\nThe Gouge Check column of the Operation Navigator quickly shows you the gouge check status of each operation.\\nList Gouges\\nThis command is available after you run the Gouge Check command on the selected operations. This command opens the Tool Path Report dialog box. In that dialog box, you can view a list of gouges for each selected tool path, and open the Information window for further review and output.\\nIf you have not yet checked the operation for gouges, this option is unavailable.\\nReport Shortest Tool\\nThis command calculates the shortest tool necessary for a collision-free tool path.\\nLoad\\nThis option adds the selected tool paths to run time memory when the tool path is listed, replayed, or generated. Once loaded, the tool path remains loaded for the remainder of the work session. This results in faster response time each time the tool path is subsequently listed, replayed, or generated.\\nUnload\\nThis option removes the selected internal tool paths from run time memory, thereby freeing up space. This action is most useful when very long paths are generated or pulled in from a file. Only paths that have been saved or that are unchanged can be unloaded. Before performing the action, the paths are checked. If any of the paths cannot be unloaded, a warning message is displayed with the path names that cannot be unloaded. The action then proceeds with all the paths that can be unloaded.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/id1407812', 'document_title': 'Tilt Tool Axis', 'document_body': 'Use the Tilt Tool Axis command to avoid tool holder collisions in surface contouring, cavity milling, and Zlevel operations.

You can specify how far from the selected geometry to place the boundary plane. Use this option to define a boundary plane from contoured 3D curves or edges.\\nCustom Boundary Data\\nThe available custom boundary options depend on the following:\\nWhether you specify the boundary within a parent geometry group or within an operation.\\nThe type of boundary.\\nOffset\\nAvailable for boundaries specified in a parent geometry group.\\nLets you specify an offset value for the entire boundary. For example, if you select part geometry to define the blank boundary, you can add an offset value to represent the casting thickness.\\nStock\\nAvailable for some operation-specific boundaries.\\nLets you specify a stock value for the boundary.\\nCut Feed Rate\\nAvailable for some operation-specific boundaries.\\nMembers\\nThe Members options are available after you select one or more boundary members from the list.

For example, the die_sequence type contains geometry groups that create complete processes for Zlevel cutting, zigzag cutting, and 3D profiling.\\nThe process assistants are provided for these. To read more about it go to Mold and Die Setups.\\nParent Group/Subtype\\nDescription\\nSEQUENCE_ZIGZAG\\nUse this option to cut mold cores and cavities that are mostly shallow, without steep walls or deep areas. After the initial roughing, it uses a series of operations that finish the areas with zig-zag cutting in a criss-cross fashion, and flowcut to cut the valleys. The operations use progressively smaller tools, stock, and tolerance. Common tools and methods are included in the setup, so you can modify the predefined operations, or create more of your own.\\nSEQUENCE ZLEVEL\\nUse this option to cut mold cores and cavities containing steep walls or deep areas. After the initial roughing, it uses a series of operations that finish the areas with zig-zag cutting in the non-steep areas, zlevel cutting in the steep areas, and flowcut to cut the valleys. The operations use progressively smaller tools, stock, and tolerance. Common tools and methods are included in the setup, so you can modify the predefined operations, or create more of your own.\\nSEQUENCE IPW\\nUse this option to rough a mold core or cavity with rest milling. It uses a series of cavity milling operations with progressively smaller tools. Using the in process workpiece (IPW), each operation cuts only the material remaining from the previous operations. This is commonly used to reduce the steps left by roughing, and to clean out material in corners left by a larger tool.\\nSEQUENCE_PROFILE_2D\\nUse this option to cut a 2d profile with a series of five operations, using progressively smaller tools and less stock. A common boundary is machined, and the depth is controlled with the floor plane. The operations use the 2D in process workpiece (IPW) to clean out the material in the corners that are left by the previous tool. This is commonly used for the edges of trim dies.\\nSEQUENCE_PROFILE_3D\\nUse this option to cut a 3d profile with a series of five operations, using progressively smaller tools and less stock. A common boundary is machined, and the depth is controlled by offsetting from the height of the edges or curves used to create the boundary. The operations use the 2D in process workpiece (IPW) to clean out the material in the corners that are left by the previous tool. This is commonly used for the edges of trim dies.\\nSEQUENCE_TOOL\\nThis demonstrates the use of holder collision checking and minimum material removal in a series of cavity milling operations. The sequence starts with a short tool, and each following operation uses a longer tool. If any of the operations will remove less than 35% of the remaining material, they are suppressed.\\nSEQUENCE_ZIGZAG_HSM\\nThis is similar to SEQUENCE_ZIGZAG, but the depths of cut, stepovers, stock, tolerance, corner smoothing, and engages have been modified for high speed machining of mold steel.\\nSEQUENCE_ZLEVEL_HSM\\nThis is similar to SEQUENCE_ZlEVEL, but the depths of cut, stepovers, stock, tolerance, corner smoothing, and engages have been modified for high speed machining of mold steel.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/create_geometry_parent', 'document_title': 'Create a geometry parent', 'document_body': 'Geometry parents are used to define geometry for manufacturing.

The tool number cannot be changed manually without breaking the library link to the tool.\\nAssign Tool Number at the Pocket Level\\nThe most common scenario is to assign the T code to the tool position number on the machine. When the program asks for T1, the tool in pocket 1 is loaded. If this is how your machines work, create pockets in the Tool View, and assign them numbers to match your machine. This can be part of your setup template or library machine, so you do not need to do this for every program. Whenever you put a tool in a pocket, it inherits the tool number from the pocket. When you assign an operation to a tool, it inherits the tool number from the tool.\\nAssigning The Tool Number To The Pocket\\nAssign Tool Number at the Tool Level\\nThe second most common scenario is to assign numbers to tools as tool codes, regardless of what pocket they are placed in on the machine. For example, a tool has a code of 1234, possibly programmed on a baluf chip or some other device. In this case, you should not use the pockets in the Tool View. You should assign the correct tool number to each tool, either in the tool dialog or in the tool library. Any operation assigned to the tool inherits the number from the tool.\\nAssigning The Tool Number in The Tool Dialog\\nIf the tools in your library always have the same preassigned number, you can modify the tool library to assign the tool number, adjust register, and cutcom register for each tool.\\nAssign Tool Number at the Operation Level\\nIn the third most common scenario, you may have a tool defined in the system that represents several identical tools on the machine. You might also have a tool defined in the system that has one tool number in one program in the setup, and a different number in another program in the same setup. In these cases, because the tool needs several different tool numbers to be output, enter a tool number in each operation that is assigned to the tool.\\nAssigning the Tool Number to the Operation\\nLibrary tool number\\nWhen a tool is created and saved to the library, or when a tool is retrieved from the library, and the tool is placed in a pocket in the manufacturing setup.\\nIf the tool number is greater than zero, the number cannot be changed manually without breaking the library link to that tool.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/parent_groups_parent_tool_column', 'document_title': 'Customize the Tool Number column', 'document_body': 'The Tool Number column in the Operation Navigator displays the tool number at the operation level in the Tool and Program Order Views.\\nTo add the Tool Number column in the Operation Navigator:\\nIn the Operation Navigator, click MB3 on the background and select columns.

The default value is (0,0,0). The point is not displayed in the tool path.\\nSpecify—Sets the Gohome point location. You can either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.\\nTool Axis\\nNone—Sets the From Point tool axis to 0,0,1.\\nSpecify—Sets the Tool axis orientation. You can either select geometry or use the Vector Constructor to orient the tool axis.\\nTransfer/Rapid\\nPart Safe Clearance\\nDefines an additional clearance that the non-cutting portions of the tool may not encroach.\\nCommon Clearance\\nClearance Option\\nUse Inherited—Selects the clearance plane specified at the MCS level.\\nPlane—Specifies the clearance plane for this operation.\\nTransfer/Rapid\\nSmooth Transfer Move Corners\\nApplies smoothing between transfer moves and adjacent approach or departure moves.\\nSmooth Transfer Move Corners\\nAvailable when you select the Smooth Transfer Move Corners check box.\\nThis is the dimension that NX applies to the smooth path. You can specify either the radius value in the current units, for example, mm, or a percentage of the tool's diameter (% Tool Diameter).\\nTolerance\\nSets the allowed deviation of the output linear moves from a calculated smooth spline. As the tolerance decreases, the number of output steps in the tool path increases and the motion becomes smoother.\\nFrom Cutting—Uses the specified Intol and Outtol values for cutting moves to control the number of straight steps required for the stepover. Output is typically a lot of lines of code with very smooth motion. This method is recommended for multi-axis operations.\\nSpecify—Lets you specify a smoothing tolerance that generates the number of straight steps that you find acceptable. Use this method if the other two options do not satisfy your needs.\\nMore\\nCheck for Non Cutting Collisions\\nDetects collisions with part and check geometry. All applicable stocks and safe clearances are added to part and check geometry for the collision checking. NX always attempts a backup move to avoid collisions if the original move gouges. If a gouge-free traversal move cannot be made, a warning is issued.\"}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/com_generate_tool_paths', 'document_title': 'Generating and reviewing your tool path', 'document_body': 'There are several ways in which you can generate an operation tool path.

To maintain the process sheets you must manually synchronize multiple inputs and this process can be error prone. It is also easy to overlook automatic changes to the NC program. To create job process sheets that NX can automatically update, use the Documentation operation or the Author Work Instructions command.\\nIn a typical workflow you create a Documentation operation where you create job process sheets with information such as setup instructions, a tool list, and an operation list for the overall program. You place the Documentation operation at the beginning of the program. You then use the Author Work Instructions command to create and attach job process sheets to individual CAM operations. NX updates all associative data in your job process sheets, for example:\\nDrafting sheets\\nTool information\\nTool and operation lists\\nMOM variables\\nLightweight section views\\nWhen your workflow is complete, you can publish the job process sheets as PDF or HTML files.

All of these Template files and Event Handler files as well as the shop_doc.dat files must be located in the shop_doc_folder or contain complete file paths. The following are some suggestions for customization:\\nTo make small changes to an existing format, you can edit the existing Template file.\\nFor larger changes you can make a copy of the Event Handler and Template file and add a new entry to the .dat file. Then make a change to the copies.\\nNote:\\nWARNING: Prior to the first time you customize any files make a copy of the entire shop_doc folder and give it a different name. All customizing changes should be made in this new folder. Otherwise, when a new version of NX is loaded, it overrides all your customized changes. Update the environment variable in the ugii environment file to point to your new folder.\\nConfiguration File\\nTo customize the available formats in the Shop Documentation scroll bar, make all your changes in shop_doc.dat file.\\nWarning:\\nWARNING: Remember, if you are making any changes in the dialog it is easiest to keep all the Template and Event Handler files in the shop_doc folder.

The command_string specifies the objects search and specifies what to do with the information extracted. The object is always the first word in the command_string.\\nMOM_cycle_objects\\nMOM_cycle_objects is used to systematically search through the CAM objects in the setup. The objects can be cycled in any of the four views.\\nObject Retrieval\\nBased on the specified object type, MOM_cycle_objects loads all the parameters and attributes that belong to each object in a class.\\nObject Selection\\nThe retrieved contents of each object may be subject to a selection process specified by a query expression. Only the object containing a parameter(s) or an attribute(s) that satisfies the query criteria is passed onto the next step.\\nData Enhancement\\nIn addition to the default contents, the information of each object may be enhanced by deriving new data from the existing one based on the specified instruction (Header Body Footer).\\nPresentation\\nThis is the end result of all of the format choices you have made.  The information is generally divided into header, body and footer. The header section contains the introductory statements regarding a particular class of objects. The body section contains the detailed description of each individual object. And the footer section presents the ending statements about this class of interest.\\nSyntax of MOM_cycle_objects\\nObject Retrieval is conducted based on the specified object type. Object Selection, Data Enhancement, and Presentation is performed based on a list of keywords. The syntax of the command is shown in the following section.\\nWhen you expand the command string and cycle multiple objects you receive a command format that is displayed below:\\nMOM_cycle_objects \\n   {object_type keyword=string keyword=string  \\n       {object_type keyword=string keyword=string  \\n           {object_type keyword=string keyword=string  \\n                {...\\n                }\\n           }\\n       }\\n   }\\nObject Types\\nThe system defines object types for the setup, for each view, and for most of the objects that the system can encounter while cycling. In general, the system starts cycling at the setup level and then proceeds to one of the four views. From there it cycles for specific object types or for MEMBERS, depending on the command string.  \\nAlthough the system cycles all objects, it can only use these object types in the command:\\nSETUP\\nPROGRAMVIEW\\nGEOMVIEW\\nMETHODVIEW\\nMACHVIEW\\nMEMBERS\\nOPER\\nTOOL\\nIf you use MEMBERS all objects at the current level are cycled regardless of their type. For example, if the object is a group, then its members are cycled. When all the members of the group have been cycled, then each member within each member of the group is cycled. The system continues cycling until all the objects are cycled.\\nWhen you use members, since any object type can be found, use the special tcl procedures for each object, as shown in the MOM_cycle_objects procedures chart.  \\nFor more information, please read more about object types.\\nKeywords\\nDefault Header, Body and Footer Procedures\\nDuring the execution of MOM_cycle_objects, the following event handlers (Tcl procedures), if supplied, are triggered automatically for each object type to present the header, body and footer descriptions:\\nproc MOM_objectType_HDR (Header)\\nproc MOM_objectType_BODY (Body)\\nproc MOM_objectType_FTR (Footer)\\nThe object type can be any of those found in mom_rm_names.c. You have to supply all the necessary event handlers for the object types being interrogated.\\nThese default headers, bodies and footers, if present, are executed before the ones specified by using the keywords (HDRT, BDYT and FTRT) discussed in the Keywords section.\\nNote:\\nThe Unused Items group is a special system group and is not cycled like other MEMBERS.\\nObject Hierarchy\\nThe hierarchy of the CAM objects dictates the types of sub-objects that are interrogated under certain object types. This hierarchy is best seen by looking in the Operation Navigator.\\nWe see in the Operation Navigator that in a given SETUP there are four views: Program Order View, Machine Tool View, Geometry View, and Machining Method View, which correspond to views organized by the Program, Method, Geometry and Machine Tools respectively. In each view there are a variety of object types that may appear. For example, in Machine Tool View we have a Machine Tool. Under Machine Tool are Cutting Tools, and under Cutting tools are the operations.\\nOperation Navigator ->Machine Tool View or the Tool View Icon\\nUse the Operation Navigator to view the hierarchy and its various creation dialogs to determine exactly which object types can appear in a view and how those object types may be arranged with respect to each other.\\nTables\\nA common format for Shop Documentation is tables. Tables within the documentation are defined in three sections: header, body, and footer. The header and footer are usually constant titles for the tables and therefore you can use literals. The body includes the variable data in the table. Because the data changes in this case, you can use the Tcl commands.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/mainmenu_main_shop_keywords', 'document_title': 'Keywords', 'document_body': 'With each object type you can use optional keywords.

You can define your own attribute identifiers which you need to describe your tools. The FORMAT line includes all the parameters which you wish to input for each data record in that class.

A DATA record consists of the keyword DATA followed by a list of attribute values separated by '|'. The DATA record corresponding to the above FORMAT line might look like this:\\nDATA | ugt0201_001 |02| 01|01|01| End Mill |TMC0_00006|HSS-Co5-TiN | 320 | Steep Taper 20 | 10.5 | 35.3| 4| 55\\nIn the data record:\\nThere must be the same number of parameters as there are DB_IDs in the FORMAT line above (an empty parameter is permissible).\\nEach parameter must be separated by the pipe symbol ( | ).

In the device library, the top-level class is the device, and so on.\\nFor example, in dbc_tool_ascii.def, the parent class is TOOL. The parent class and each subclass is defined with a CLASS statement. Within the TOOL class, the subclass MILLING is defined, and within the MILLING class, further subclasses are defined, such as END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE.\\nEach top-level subclass has a type that is identified by the T field. Each tool type has subtypes that are identified by the ST field.\\nExample:\\nTool type:\\nMilling with T = 02\\nSubtypes:\\nEnd Mills Non-indexable with ST = 01\\nEnd Mills Indexable with ST = 02\\nEach type T must be mapped to a corresponding NX internal data type, UGT, and each subtype ST must be mapped to a corresponding NX internal data subtype, UGST.\\nExample:\\nThe Milling tools class with T = 02 has a Chamfer Mills Non-indexable subclass with ST = 05.

There is no reason to change any of these.\\nNotice the common structure that is used for parameters: name, type, value, and label become elements in a row of the parameter array.\\nproc SetParameter { name pType value label } is called for integers (pType=\"i\"), decimal number or double numbers (pType=\"d\"), Boolean values (pType=\"b\"), and text strings (pType=\"s\").\\nproc SetOptionParameter { name value values label } is called for the more complexly structured option lists (pType=\"o\"). Here, value is the default value that appears in the list, and values is an array of possible values. The type parameter is not needed; in Tcl, everything is a string, so it does not matter.\\nThe next procedure, AskAttVal { attId dbRow outputFormat defaultValue flagRef }, gets the value of a parameter from a row in the database and returns a flag indicating failure or degrees of success.\\nThe procedure FindEntry {} gets a row of data from the database.\\nThe procedure DBC_ud_data {} is the area that you can customize.\\nIn the body of the DBC_ud_data procedure, after the variable declarations and the initialization of a variable that tracks the number of parameters, set dbc_ud_num_parameters 0, remove or comment out lines for parameter types that you are not going to use.\\nAdd rows or modify the sample rows for data types that you require.\\nFor data types “i”, “d”, “b”, and “s”, new data is created by a simple procedure call of the format:\\nSetParameter \"parameter name\" \"type\" numeric_value \"Label\"\\nor\\nSetParameter \"parameter name\" \"type\" \"boolean or string value\" \"Label\"\\nFor the option list, you must set values and value before you call SetOptionParameter. Notice that the method used to set the default value value is the statement set value [lindex $values 0]. The second argument to lindex is a reference to the zero-based index of the default choice, within the array of possible values choices. For the example list with the values { \"Yes\" \"No\" \"Maybe\" }, valid values for the second argument of the lindex command are 0, 1, and 2.

It sets the speed, feeds, depth of cut, and stepover values based on the current cutting conditions. The Machining Data library improves on the Feeds and Speeds library (which only sets the speed and feed values) for milling. To efficiently cut similar parts, determine the optimum parameter settings for your cutting conditions, and add them to the Machining Data Library. Any user can then apply these settings to his/her operations. The library uses three primary inputs from the operation: Tool Material, Part Material, and Cut Method. The secondary inputs are Tool Diameter and Tool Length.\\nNote:\\nMachining Data libraries are typically set up by a site administrator. You must have write access to the library files to edit them.\\nTurning operations do not use the Machining Data libraries.

Machine data for all other length/diameter ratios are interpolated.\\nReferences to Other Libraries\\nThe Machining Data Library references entries within other manufacturing libraries. These libraries are shared with the feeds and speeds system, so changes to these tables may affect both feeds and speeds and machining data calculations. Modifying or deleting an entry within the Machining Data Library doesn't affect the referenced entry in any other library. The Machining Data Library references the following libraries (tables):\\nPart Material\\nTool Material\\nCut Method\\nCutting Tools\\nMachine Tools (Machines)\\nIn addition, if you have used the feeds and speeds system to store machining data, you can import data from the Feeds and Speeds library into the Machining Data library.\\nSample Entry\\nA sample entry for a P20 Mold Steel part (MAT0_00464), cut with an HSM Carbide Ball Mill (TMC0_00021), using the HSM Rough Milling cut method (OPD0_00021) ), and displayed in inches, would be:\\nLibref\\nDiameter\\nLength\\nCut Depth\\nStepover\\nSurface Speed\\nFeed per Tooth\\nTHSO_00299\\n.9449\\n2.8346\\n0.1504\\n0.1890\\n853.0184\\n0.0087\\nApproach %\\nEngage %\\nFirst Cut %\\nStepover %\\nRetract %\\nReturn %\\nDeparture %\\n0\\n80\\n60\\n60\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nNote:\\n Library values are stored in both inch and metric units.

Each attribute in the database has a unique name. In NX Library, these attributes are assigned an alias and referred to as a DB_ALIAS. This alias must also be unique. You can only search for a database attribute that has been assigned a DB_ALIAS in the .def file. It is the DB_ALIAS name that is referred to in the type hierarchy section of the .def file to indicate which attributes are to be included in the Search Criteria dialog.\\nlibref\\nThis is the DB_ALIAS of the library reference. It is mandatory that this DB_ALIAS appears in the alias list.\\nType\\nSubtype\\nDescr\\nThese three DB_ALIASes are most commonly found and should therefore be contained in the list of DB_ALIASes.

NX is delivered with a manufacturing environment already defined. The advantage of the NX system compared to other systems is that the description of the environment has been greatly expanded and you have the ability to customize this environment completely in order to enhance your productivity.\\nOur recommendation is to copy the ${UGII_BASE_DIR}\\\\MACH\\\\resource folder and set the variable UGII_CAM_RESOURCE_DIR to point to your copy. Do all of your customization in your copy of the resource folder structure.\\nNote:\\nWhen you set the environment variable for UGII_CAM_RESOURCE_DIR, you must add a backslash (\\\\) to the end of the path to make it complete and comprehensive.\\nExample:\\nThe following types of data that can be customized:\\nManufacturing Templates\\nDefinitions of Output formats.\\nDefinitions of libraries and library data.\\nProcess Assistants\\nA CAM environment exists from the time you first enter the Manufacturing module to the time you exit NX. The data in the environment is part file independent, which means it stays the same even if multiple parts are being used. This is logical because the same environment manufactures several parts.\\nThis section describes each component of the machining environment and the benefits of customization. Later sections describe how the system is initially delivered and how to accomplish desired customization. Further details about each component may be found throughout the documentation.\\nIntent of the Customizing Tools\\nThe Manufacturing environment consists of the following:\\nManufacturing Templates\\nOperation templates\\nMethod templates\\nTool Templates\\nGeometry Templates\\nSetup templates\\nOutput Control\\nAvailable CLSF formats\\nTool-path listing format\\nAvailable Postprocessor templates\\nAvailable Shop Floor Documentation Templates\\nUser defined events\\nNX Library\\nMachine Tool Library\\nTool Library\\nPart Material Library\\nTool Material Library\\nCut methods\\nFeed and Speed Database\\nProcess Assistants\\nManufacturing Templates\\nThe manufacturing templates are containers of procedures and option settings. They allow you to use the CAM system from different perspectives. You can use these templates to customize the workflow presented by NX and to customize the default settings for options. Using these templates, users can gain access to any portion of the full Manufacturing functionality, thus allowing for consistent and focused usage. Using these templates, users can also gain access to different sets of predefined values, which allow greater productivity in repetitive situations.\\nFive types of templates are available in the manufacturing environment: Operation, Method, Tool, Geometry, and Setup. Each one contains different data.\\nOperation templates are used to set values for all options within an operation. For example, there may be a template for point to point operations that includes all of the desired default settings for drilling. The data is stored as an operation itself, which is then retrieved to initialize the values for other operations.\\nNote:\\nOperation Templates initialize operation parameter values\\nMethod templates control the setting of options that you want to be common throughout the setup. The options that can be defined as such are: stock, tolerances, feed rates and display parameters. The advantage of this capability is consistent machining throughout the setup while only having to specify values once.\\nNote:\\nMethod Templates initialize setup option values\\nTool templates control which types of tool assemblies (tool and holders) are available to be created in your CAM environment, and control the setting of default values for these tools. For example, you may want to limit the types of tools that can be created because you want to force the use of standard tools retrieved from a library. The advantage is great for customers with specialized libraries.\\nNote:\\nTool Templates initialize available tools and their parameter values\\nGeometry templates control which type of geometry is available to be selected within the environment, and a machining sequence for that type of geometry. A geometry template can be defined for hole geometry, boundary geometry, face and body geometry, and turning boundaries. You can save a sequence of operation templates with each of the geometry templates. The advantage of this is that the user can establish a predefined process to machine a certain geometry feature. In the example, a sequence of center drill, drill and ream operation templates can be saved for the hole geometry group.\\nNote:\\nGeometry Templates initialize a sequence of operations for a given geometry type\\nSetup templates are used to initialize the entire CAM environment by providing any combination of operation, method, tool, and geometry templates at the same time. The setup is represented by all of the CAM data in the part.\\nNote:\\nSetup Templates initialize the entire manufacturing environment\\nOperation and group templates are classified with a user-defined type and subtype.\\nThe type defines a collection of information that is used for one machining discipline. It is a part name that defines the part where the information is saved.\\nThe subtype defines a collection of information that represents one specific process within that machining discipline. This specific process could be operation templates and/or group templates. For operation templates, the subtype is an operation within the part listed as the type. For group templates, the subtype is a group within the part listed as the type.\\nOutput Control\\nYou have control over the content and format of the output. The following outputs can be customized:\\nCLSF format\\nThis is the format of the CLSF records. For example, NX includes three formats: Standard, BCL and ISO. You can then customize any additional formats.\\nTool Path Listing format\\nThis is the text format for output.\\nShop floor documentation format\\nThis defines the format for such capabilities as tool lists, operation sheets and process plans.\\nMachine Output format\\nThis is the format of the PTP file. The format might be customizable depending on the desired machine tool/controller combination being used.\\nUser Defined Events format\\nThis is the format for output of postprocessor commands in the toolpath. This can be used to customize post sequences such as tool changes and load sequences.\\nNX Library\\nCAM offers the capability to store and retrieve information in libraries. This is very useful for information that is to be used repeatedly in many setups in a consistent manner. These libraries allow you to retrieve data into the setup. The libraries can be customized to include the exact type and content of data that is desired.\\nLibrary control is provided for tools, tool assemblies (tool plus holder), machine tools, machinability data (feeds/speeds), cut methods, and material (part plus tool).\\nTwo versions of libraries are available; a text version and a full capability integrated library mechanism.\\nProcess Assistants\\nProcess Assistants allow you to control the sequence of NC programming activities to be presented in the user interface. The aid is a wizard like manufacturing process assistant. This processing assistant defines the sequence of NC programming activities to be presented in the user interface.\\nNote:\\nGeometry Templates initialize a sequence of operations for a given geometry\\nManufacturing processing assistants control the sequence of interactive dialogs presented to the user for a sequence of operations. NX provides an initial set of Manufacturing processing assistants based upon extensive industry research. These are available within several products and product bundles. Currently, you may not create your own manufacturing processing assistants. This capability will be allowed in the future.\\nManufacturing processing assistants are most productive when used in conjunction with manufacturing templates. For example, a geometry template can be used to define a sequence of operations (and their options) to be applied to a type of geometry (ie. a die). A processing assistant can then be applied to control the user interface. For example, the processing assistant can lead you to always be asked to select a tool or a Machine Coordinate System for each operation. A processing assistant can also allow the selection of tolerances to be by passed so that the default values are always used. An example of this can be seen by choosing the Mill contour die mold configuration, and selecting a mold or die sequence setup.\\nWith these aids, you can customize the CAM interaction, process, and values to match your particular needs.\\nConfiguration Management\\nThe Configuration of the CAM system is the state of all of the customizable options at any one time. A configuration file keeps the record of these states and is the function used to define the customized environment.\\nThe Manufacturing system is delivered with the configuration completely defined. There are several supplied configurations within which you can choose to work. If these are not appropriate, the system can be further or totally customized and then a new or modified configuration file used to define this new environment.\\nThe supplied Configuration files include versions customized for each of three market segments: Mold and Die, Machinery, and High End.\\nThe configuration file consists of a list of links that point to separate files. Each of these separate files, called reference files, contains the format for one type of customizable data.\\nAll configuration files, whether supplied with the software, or created by the user, must have the same format: a key word followed by an environment variable. The key word identifies the type of data to be customized, and the environment variable identifies the location of a reference file that has the customized format for that data.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/cust_configuration', 'document_title': 'Manufacturing Configuration Files', 'document_body': 'Manufacturing configuration files define the complete Manufacturing working environment.

These objects are not copied and the search in that branch of the tree is complete.\\nIn the Geometry View of the template part, during the search, if an operation with Create if Parent is created is encountered, then it is created in the work part, under the same geometry group.\\nBecause each operation requires 4 parents, the other parents, Program, Tool, and Method are checked. If objects of the same name already exist in the work part, then the operation is placed under the existing groups. If corresponding object do not exist in the work part, they are created, and the operation is placed under the new group.\\nThe typical use of Create if Parent is created is to apply it to operations in a geometry group.\\nWhen the geometry group is created, the operations are created, and the tools, programs, and methods that they reference.\\nIn the following example, Object can be used as a template is selected for WORKPIECE which places WORKPIECE in the Create Geometry dialog box as a subtype icon. Create if Parent is created is also selected, which creates the WORKPIECE group every time its parent, MCS_MILL, is created as a group. For the MCS icon to appear in the Create Geometry dialog box, MCS_MILL must also be highlighted in the Operation Navigator and Object can be used as a template selected.\\nMCS_MILL\\nWORKPIECE\\nWhenever MCS_MILL is created as a group by selecting the subtype icon and Create, WORKPIECE is also created as illustrated below. Think of the Create if Parent is created option as meaning; \"whenever you create my parent group, the system automatically creates me too\".\\nCreate if Parent is created is sometimes used to load a predefined sequence of operations. Although the specified operations must have four parents (a Program parent, a Tool parent, a Geometry Parent, and a Method parent), operations are loaded only when creating Geometry groups. This applies, for example, even if you specify Create if Parent is created in the Machine Tool View. The parent tool will not load the operations. The parent geometry loads the operations.\\nThe Create if Parent is created option also allows you to determine which groups and operations in a Template Part File appear automatically in the Operation Navigator.\\nSpecify Create if Parent is created for a continuous sequence of groups and operations, beginning at the root. All of the template groups and operations are created automatically, and appear in the Operation Navigator, when you select the template part as a Setup in the Machining Environment dialog box.\\nIn the following figure, Create if Parent is created has been specified for MCS_MILL, WORKPIECE, CAVITY_MILL, and FIXED_CONTOUR. Because these groups and operations are in a contiguous, unbroken sequence, and because the selected sequence begins at the root (GEOMETRY), the groups and operations will be created automatically in the Operation Navigator when you initially specify the template part file as the setup.\\nGeometry\\nMCS_MILL\\nWORKPIECE\\nCAVITY_MILL\\nFIXED_CONTOUR'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/customize_cust_create_temp', 'document_title': 'Creating and Using Template Sets', 'document_body': 'How to Create a Template Set\\nTemplate sets are useful because they make Template part files available for selection from within the dialog boxes, preventing you from having to browse for individual parts. A Template Set is an ASCII text file that lists the Part files containing templates as illustrated below. The default Template Set is determined by the Configuration File.\\nNote:\\nIf you are in a Teamcenter environment, or if your configuration includes LIBRARY_SETUP_TEMPLATE, such as cam_library, then the list of template parts comes from the library and not the .opt file. See Data Management for more information.\\nEach Part file usually contains several Operations and Groups. A Drill Part file, for example, may contain a Center Drill, Drill, and Ream Operation. If too many template operations of the same type in a single part file are created, the Create dialogs can become too tall for the user interface.\\nWhen you create Operations or groups to be saved in the Part file, you may also want to customize the appearance of the Operation dialog box so that only those options appear when you later create Operations using the Template. Be sure to verify that in the Template Setting dialog box, the Object can be used as a template check box is selected.\\nRight-click the operation and choose Object→Template Settings.\\nOnce the Template Part files have been created and saved, you will group them together logically into Template Sets. A Template Set is defined by creating an ASCII text file as illustrated below. This text file must contain the path name and the file name of each Template Part file in the set, and must be saved with a .opt extension. You may insert commentary text after ## characters.\\nASCII Text File Defining a Template Set\\nNote:\\nEnglish and Metric template files are mutually exclusive. This is intentional, as it allows Operation defaults for either English or Metric units.\\nSave the ASCII text file in the desired folder. Be sure to include the .opt extension. In this example the text file is saved as: /cam/temp/templ1.opt .\\nNote:\\nYou can embed environmental variables in the Part file name.\\nOnce Template Sets have been created, you may select which set to use when creating new Operations. For this example, we will assume that the following Template Sets have been created:\\n/cam/temp/templ1.opt /cam/temp/templ2.opt /cam/temp/templ3.opt\\nHow to Select a Template Set\\nTo specify which template set to use, do the following:\\nChoose Menu→Preferences→Manufacturing.\\nClick the Configuration tab.\\nIn the Template Set group, click Browse .\\nSelect the desired Template Set from the file list.\\nYou can only specify one template set.\\nClick OK to confirm the selection.\\nIn the Manufacturing Preferences dialog box, click OK.\\nNX scans the Template Part files in the selected set to determine which have matching units (inch/metric) and to define the Type and Subtype options that will appear in the Operation and Group creation dialog boxes. When a Template is retrieved, some parameters are reoriented based on the the Reference Coordinate System (RCS) found in the MCS or other geometry orientation groups. NX will continue to use the specified Template Set for the remainder of your logon session or until you specify another Template Set.\\nNote:\\nAlthough the Status line indicates that the Template Part files are being \"Loaded\", they are actually being \"scanned\" to check the units and to define the Type and Subtype options that will appear in the Operation Definition section of the Operation Parameters dialog box. The Template Part files are not being \"loaded\" in the usual sense of the word in that they are not being copied in as data sets.\\nNote:\\nWhile in manufacturing, the template part that is currently selected will be open throughout the session.\\nHow to Select a Template\\nThe Template Set you have selected determines the Type options and the available Subtype icons that will appear in both the Create Operation and Create Group dialog boxes.\\nThe Type options correspond to the Template Part file names. The Subtype options (icons) correspond to the Operation and Group names within the Template Part file (Type). The selected Type determines which Subtype options (icons) are available.\\nThe Name field indicates the name that will be used when you create the operation or group.\\nTools will only be created with an operation if the operation template has Create if Parent is created toggled ON. If the template loads a tool with the same name but different parameters as a tool in the current Part file, a new tool with different name is created and is associated with the new operation.\\nOnce you have specified the Type and Subtype, select OK or Apply to make a new Operation or Group that uses the parameters defined by the Type and Subtype.\\nHow to Reset Back to the System Default Template Set\\nChoose Menu→Preferences→Manufacturing.\\nClick the Configuration tab.\\nIn the Template Set group, click Reset to Default .\\nThe default Template Set is determined by the Configuration File. You may also change the active Template Set by specifying a different Configuration File using the Specify Configuration File button.\\nSummary\\nHere is a summary of key points and a diagram that illustrates how the various aspects of Templates relate to one another.\\nA Template is an Operation or Group saved in a Template Part File.\\nA Template Part file is Part file containing CAM Operations and Groups with specific pre-defined parameters and customized dialogs.\\nA Template Set is a collection (logical grouping) of Template Part files.

The dialog launches in NX and then returns to the wizard when the end user selects OK or Cancel.\\nNote:\\nFor more information, see MenuScript User's Guide.\\nMenuScript Concepts\\nThe NX Dialog or MenuScript step uses the same menuscript buttons as those found in NX .men files. As shown in the following example, ug_sfem.men leads to UG_SFEM_INSERT_PARTITION_SOLID, which invokes the Partition dialog.\\nBUTTON UG_SFEM_INSERT_PARTITION_SOLID\\nLABEL &Partition Model...\\nBITMAP split.bmp\\nACTIONS STANDARD\\nOptions available in the NX Dialog step include a Menubar specification and a Button specification. The Menubar element identifies user-defined menu bars and buttons. If you don't specify a Menubar string, the NX internal menu bars will search for the Button definition.\\nNX Dialog Guidelines\\nThe NX Dialog step use may be restricted in the Manufacturing Wizard by the NX UI state. For example, while in the Structures application, many dialogs are turned off because their actions are not appropriate to the Structures application. Available dialogs are therefore determined by the UI state. If the process is being run in the Manufacturing Wizard and the current UI state restricts access to a particular button definition, the NX Dialog-defined step will display a status message and will skip that step.\\nSince there is no wizard dialog for the NX Dialog step, meaning that in the Manufacturing Wizard the target dialog simply appears, you may want to add a Message step before the NX Dialog step to display additional information, or to point to additional information for the benefit of the consumer.\\nGroup NX Dialog Step\\nWith the Group step selected, you can access all the functions available for the User-Defined group step.\\nIndividual NX Dialog Step\\nProperty\\nValue\\nDescription\\nHelp URL\\nHTML-formatted file or target\\nDefault HTML target, which you can change.\\nNX Dialog\\nNX Menu Bar\\nNX Menu Bar string\\nValid NX Menu Bar string; for example,  UG_GATEWAY_MAIN_MENUBAR\\nNX Menu Button\\nNX Menu Button string\\nValid NX Menu Button string; for example, UG_APP_SFEM UG_SFEM_INSERT_SUBDIVIDE_FACE\"}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/Steps_usr_def_message', 'document_title': 'Message Step', 'document_body': 'This step is a user-defined step that enables the display of a message in the wizard.

This option should be used for fixed axis machining, when the tool axis is aligned with the ZM axis, to perform high speed operations requiring a very smooth and accurate surface cut (particularly on contoured surfaces) and when your Fanuc, Seimens, Heidenhain, or Fidia UNC control supports Nurbs input. The finished part should not deviate from the design geometry more than the specified Intol/Outtol if the defined Fitting Control Tolerance is within the Intol/Outtol band. If a smoother tool path is desired, you can specify a tighter Fitting Control Tolerance. When using this option, the tool displays only at the beginning and end of each cutting pass regardless of the specified Display Frequency.\\nSee User Defined operations and CLSF for the Standard B-Spline Format.\\nSinumerik Spline\\nOutputs splines for Siemens Sinumerik controllers. The Sinumerik Spline output is optimized for Zig cut patterns in finishing operations, and is best suited for the Area Mill drive method.\\nThe spline format uses G2 continuity where possible. This helps to ensure that the tool paths run smoothly. The tool path is expected to run faster and produce a smoother surface finish.

In addition, a CYCLE/ON event is add added to the start of the tool path and a CYCLE/OFF event is added at the end of the path.\\nNote:\\nCircle records output to the CLSF or NC file are generated from either selected geometry or the postprocessor. If the radius of the circle is outside the range defined in the postprocessor, then the postprocessor outputs a warning indicating that the radius is out of range.

Most of these options pertain to triangulating the solid or sheet bodies. Once you have specified these parameters, you will select OK to specify the .ply output file name.\\nIn order to process the solid or sheet bodies, the system must determine surface adjacencies, triangulate each surface making sure all edge vertices match, and determine normals to the triangles which point toward the outside of the surfaced body. To process the selected bodies, the system directly triangulates them and then outputs the triangles and normals to the .ply output file for use with Vericut. The coordinates of the triangulated in the .ply output file are in the Absolute Coordinate System.\\nTriangulated Body\\nThe accuracy of the triangulation processing for surfaces is dependent upon three factors: 1) the edge tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation, 2) the trim tolerance used in Trim Surface, 3) the triangulation tolerance.\\nThe edge and trim tolerances determine how accurately the surface edges stored in the data base are positioned in relation to the true edges. Triangles along the edge of a surface have one or more vertices on the edge stored in the data base. Thus, inaccuracies in the edges stored in the data base result in inaccuracies in triangles along the edge of a surface.\\nIt is imperative that you understand and set the tolerances correctly. Triangle Tol (triangulation tolerance) determines how smooth the approximation of the surface/solid will be. The smaller this number, the more triangular facets the system will generate as it attempts to simulate smoother contoured surfaces (see the Triangulation Tolerances figure). Adjacency Tol (adjacency tolerance) determines when two surfaces meet along an edge. You must be sure to coordinate this adjacency tolerance with other tolerances used throughout NX.\\nThe Edge Tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation and the Trim Tolerance used in Trim Surface determine the number of curve segments stored in the data base as an approximation of a surface edge. The smaller the tolerance, the more numerous the curve segments used to approximate an edge. When the system processes the triangulation of the surfaced model, it creates at least one triangle for each curve segment. As a result, the edge tolerance and surface trim tolerance determine the lower bound of the number of triangles produced. The number of triangles is the key determining factor in the speed of the processing.\\nGiven the minimal set of triangles determined by the edge and trim tolerance, the Triangulation Tolerance determines how many more triangles are needed to obtain the accuracy desired.\\nTo obtain the best performance possible, use the largest edge, trim, and Triangulation Tolerances possible to meet your needs. This will allow the system to correctly determine the adjacencies and to sufficiently provide accurate triangular approximation of the surfaces.\\nEach option in the Geometry Definition dialog box is described below.\\nGeometry\\nThis option is always set to Part and cannot be changed.\\nOutput Type\\nOutput Type allows you to specify the type of file in which the system stores the output. This option toggles between Binary and Text.\\nText creates an ASCII text output file that you can read and edit, although it takes up more memory space than a binary file.\\nBinary creates a binary output file. This produces the file in a more compact and efficient form, but which you cannot read or understand without some translation. The system defaults to this option.\\nTriangle Tol\\nTriangulation Tolerance allows you to enter a tolerance value which determines:\\nhow closely the triangles approximate the surface contours\\nhow close the sides of the triangles which lie along the edges are to the edges of the surface\\nThe smaller the value you enter, the more triangles the system will generate as it simulates smoother contoured surfaces. More triangular facets require more processing time.\\nTriangulation Tolerances\\nEnglish part values must range from .0001 to .1 inches with a default of .02. Metric part values must range from .0025 to 2.5 mm with a default of .5.\\nAdjacency Tol\\nAdjacency Tolerance allows you to enter a value which the system uses to determine if two surfaces will be attached to one another. The distance between two surface boundaries, as found in the data base, is calculated. If that distance is less than the Adjacency Tolerance, the two boundaries are considered to be coincident and the two surfaces are considered to be attached along that boundary. The default value for the Adjacency Tolerance is .005 for English parts, .12 for metric parts.\\nThe Adjacency Tolerance has no affect on the speed of processing the solids.\\nA boundary, as found in the data base, is an approximation of the true surface edge. For example, when a cylinder is trimmed by a bounded plane which is not perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, the true edge of the cylinder is an ellipse, but the system stores an approximating curve in the data base rather than an actual ellipse. This curve is accurate to within the trim tolerance specified when the surface was trimmed.\\nElliptical Trim of a Cylinder which Results in an Approximating Curve\\nAs a result, you must coordinate the setting of the Adjacency Tolerance with the trim tolerance used in Trim Surface (and similarly, the edge tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation)\\nUse the following as rough guidelines for specifying Adjacency Tolerances.\\nNote:\\n To avoid encountering problems with the Adjacency Tolerance, you must design NX parts with these general guidelines in mind:\\nWhen creating a bounded plane, use an edge tolerance which is less than or equal to one-half the Adjacency Tolerance.\\nLikewise, when trimming a surface, use a trim tolerance which is less than or equal to one-half the Adjacency Tolerance you will use.\\nTo produce reasonable results, set the edge and trim tolerances within a range from .001 to .0025 for English parts, .0254 to .0635 for metric parts.\\nFor the Adjacency Tolerance, set the value within a range from .0001 to .05 English, .0025 to 1.2 metric.\\nThere is one exception to these rough guidelines. If, when creating the part:\\nthe edge tolerance in bounded plane creation and the trim tolerance in surface trim is less than or equal to the default tolerance of .01 inches\\nand the edges of two adjacent surfaces are endpoint to endpoint coincident (i.e., the 3D endpoints of the two edges coincide)\\nthen these edges will always be correctly identified as adjacent regardless of the setting of the Adjacency Tolerance.\\nFor example, the adjacencies for all surfaces created by the Automatic Surfacing function within NX will be correctly determined because in this case adjacent surface edges are always endpoint to endpoint coincident and the edge tolerance used by Automatic Surfacing in the creation of bounded planes is .01 inches.\\nNote:\\nEdges whose length are smaller than the Adjacency Tolerance can cause adjacency problems if they are not endpoint to endpoint coincident. So it is best to construct surfaces so that adjacent edges are endpoint to endpoint coincident whenever possible. Not only will it help the correct determination of adjacencies, but it will also speed up the computation of those adjacencies.\\nIn general, any surface construction tolerance should be approximately 50% of the smallest machining tolerance (i.e., Intol/Outtol tolerance).\\nThe system handles these edges whose length is less than the Adjacency Tolerance in the following manner:\\nIf an edge has length less than the Adjacency Tolerance and the neighboring edges are not endpoint to endpoint adjacent, the system displays the error message More Than 2 Edges Adjacent. In most cases, the output file will be successfully processed by Vericut.\\nSmall Edge Length Produces an Error\\nIf an edge has length less than the adjacency tolerance and the neighboring edges are endpoint to endpoint adjacent, the system correctly determines the adjacencies.\\nAdjacencies Correctly Determined Along a Small Edge\\nMax Triangle Edge\\nMaximum Triangle Edge allows you to assign a maximum triangle edge length for generated triangles. This option toggles between OFF and on, with OFF being the default. When turned on, this option activates the Triangle Edge Size field below. When turned OFF, the system applies no limit to the triangle size.\\nFor normal rapid prototyping use, this option can usually be set to OFF. However, when the resulting .ply file is used for some other application (such as Vericut), it may be necessary to apply a maximum triangle size.\\nTriangle Edge Size\\nTriangle Edge Size sets the value of the maximum triangle edge size. This value has no affect if the Maximum Triangle Edge option is OFF. If it is ON, the system guarantees that no triangle edge will exceed the specified value.\\nTriangle Display\\nTriangle Display allows you to temporarily display the triangles used to create the Vericut simulation. This option toggles between OFF and ON, with OFF the default. When turned ON, this option gives you the ability to visually check the triangulation of the entities for smoothness and any potential problems. The system displays the triangles in the current system display color.\\nStep 2: Specify Output File Name\\nOnce you have specified each option in the Geometry Definition dialog box, select OK. The system then displays the following dialog box and prompts you to name the .ply output file.\\nThe system automatically appends the default extension .ply to the file name if the file is binary. It appends the default extension .txt to the file name if the file is a text file.\\nThe system checks to see if the entered file name currently exists. If it does (or if you select an existing name in the list), the system prompts you to either:\\nUse Other Name\\nReplace It\\nAppend to It\\nYou can use Append to It to put two related parts into one Vericut file.\\nStep 3: Select Geometry\\nAfter you specify the output file name, the system displays the Class Selection dialog box with the mask set to only allow selection of solid bodies and sheet bodies. In this step, you will select the bodies to which the system will apply the triangulation. The geometry you select represents the material to be simulated as illustrated below.\\nSelecting Part vs. Stock Geometry\\nGenerally, you will select the modeled Blank Geometry to simulate the removal of stock.\\nError Messages\\nThe system may also display error messages if problems were encountered in processing the selected surfaces or solids. These are NX error messages.\\nFor all error messages, the system highlights the offending edge, surface, or solid face, and then prompts you to either Continue Displaying Errors or Discontinue.\\nChoose Continue Displaying Errors for the system to resume highlighting each offending edge, surface, or solid face. Choose Discontinue to stop the output of this error message.\\nWhen the system has finished the processing of this error message it continues with subsequent processing and produces a Vericut output file.\\nThe following error messages are non-fatal:\\nEdges Not Shared By Two Surfaces\\nAny edges which are not shared by two surfaces are detected. The system highlights all such edges of a surface and displays this error message.\\nThere are two conditions which generate this message:\\nTwo surface edges that should be adjacent are found not to be. This may be caused by inexact modeling, or a violation of the guidelines for specifying adjacency tolerances. A single surface file is acceptable to Vericut for Auto Difference checking. Refer to the Vericut documentation for a description of the Auto Difference option.\\nThe edge is part of a support structure and you do not want the edge to be attached to any other edge. In this case, consider the message to be only a warning and continue running the process.\\nNormals Cannot Be Automatically Determined\\nWhen calculating the normals for surfaces, you choose a base surface to establish a correct normal for the model. If your selection of surfaces contains more than one body (a body being a group of surfaces that are all attached to one another), the system highlights all surfaces that are not connected via a chain of surfaces to the base surface and displays this error message. The system then continues the processing and will use the normals stored in the NX data base for all offending surfaces. Note that the normals for such surfaces may be incorrect.\\nThe following figure shows a part containing two separate bodies of surfaces. Since the second body selected is not connected by a chain of surfaces to the base surface, the system highlights it and displays the error message.\\nSystem Interaction when it Cannot Determine Normals\\nIf the surfaces highlighted are merely support structures, consider the message to be merely a warning; you can still use the output. Otherwise, make sure all the normals for all highlighted surfaces are correct. The Append to It option is ideally suited for handling this situation. Run the process once for each body, appending to the previous output file.\\nFatal Errors\\nThe following error messages are fatal. The resulting output file may not be processed successfully by Vericut.\\nMore Than 2 Edges Adjacent\\nIf more than two surfaces coincide along an edge, the system highlights the offending coincident edges and displays this error message. There are two conditions which can generate this message:\\nThe edge has length less than the adjacency tolerance and the neighboring edges are not endpoint to endpoint adjacent. In most cases, the output file will be processed successfully by Vericut.\\nThree or more surfaces meet along this edge.\\nDegenerate Surface\\nCertain surfaces can be constructed in NX but are degenerate. The system highlights all such surfaces and displays this error message. There are five ways in which a surface can be degenerate.\\nIf the surface only consists of two boundary curves which coincide (see Example A).\\nIf two of the boundary curves of a surface coincide (see Example B)\\nIf a hole was trimmed into a surface that lies directly on one boundary (see Example C)\\nIf a hole crosses a surface boundary (see Example D)\\nThe distance between a hole and the periphery is less than two times the edge tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation or the trim tolerance used in Trim Surface (see Example E).\\nWays in which a Surface is Degenerated\\nUnable To Triangulate Surface\\nThe system cannot triangulate the surface due to surface being corrupted, or because of a programming error.\\nUnable To Triangulate Solid Face\\nThe system cannot triangulate the solid due to a programming error.\\nVirtual Memory Exhausted\\nIf at any time during processing a dynamic memory call runs out of space, the system immediately stops the process, frees all dynamically allocated space, and displays this error message.'}, {'link': 'https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid1967924', 'document_title': 'Teamcenter Integration for NX Manufacturing', 'document_body': 'In Teamcenter Integration for NX, the Teamcenter data management tool runs as a separate process at the same time as NX.
