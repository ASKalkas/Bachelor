The Manufacturing application allows you to interactively program tool paths.
Tip: The Manufacturing application includes the Manufacturing Compare Tool Navigator. You can create and manage configurations for the compare tool navigator columns to help you analyze the differences between part revisions. For more information, see Configuring navigator columns and Manufacturing Compare Tool.

Standard Manufacturing content
Manufacturing includes
A default user interface that contains common functionality for milling, drilling, turning, and wire edm operations.
Configuration files define the available machining processors, tool libraries, postprocessors, and other high level parameters.
The Mach Kit contains the default set of configuration files, templates, and libraries delivered with each release.
The ability to customize your user interface to industry specific requirements with templates which can include machine tools, cutting tools, machining methods, shared geometry, and sequences of operations.
An organization aid, the Operation Navigator, that allows you to view and manage relationships between operations, geometry, machining methods, and tools.
Note:
The options available in Manufacturing may be different based on the role you are using. If a described option is not available, choose the CAM Essentials role, or choose the CAM Advanced role."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/intro_term,NX Manufacturing terms,"An understanding of the following terms is essential to effective usage of the Manufacturing application.
Setup
The setup is a part that can contain, or reference as components, the part to machine, blank, fixtures, clamps, and machine tool.
Assemblies
Assembly parts can be machined using NX Manufacturing applications. You can select geometry in an assembly part file or any component part file to use in an operation. If the selected geometry is located in the component part file, the CAM operation will contain an occurrence of the selected geometry. All selected geometry is associative (See Associativity).
CAM objects (Operations, Tools) can only be retrieved in the assembly part file. You can retrieve libraries of tools or a component library part file. Part merge can be used to retrieve CAM objects from the component part into the assembly part.
An assembly can be created containing components, such as clamps and fixtures. This approach:
Avoids having to merge clamp, fixture, etc. geometry into the part to be machined.
Allows you to generate fully associative tool paths for models that you may not have write access privilege.
Enables multiple NC programmers to develop NC data in separate files simultaneously.
The Manufacturing application retains the information used in generating a tool path. This capability is termed associativity.
Note:
If you are in a Teamcenter environment, or if your configuration includes LIBRARY_SETUP_TEMPLATE, such as cam_library, then the assembly can be created automatically by selecting the appropriate setup. This setup can contain CAM objects, as well as geometry and components, such as clamps. Your work part is placed in this assembly. See Data Management for more information.
Operation Navigator
The Operation Navigator is a graphical organization aid with a tree structure that illustrates relationships between the geometry, machining method, and tool parameter groups and the operations within a program. Parameters are passed down or inherited from group to group and from group to operation based on their location in the tree structure. You can view and manage relationships between operations and parameter groups to share the parameters among operations.
Except for a few cases, you can determine whether or not to apply inheritance.
Operation
An operation contains all information used to generate a single tool path.
Associativity
If the geometry or tool used for an operation is edited after generating its tool path, the operation automatically uses the new information when you regenerate. It is not necessary to re–select the geometry. If geometry required to generate the tool path is deleted, the software prompts you to specify new geometry.
Automatically updating tool paths every time geometry is altered can reduce productivity, since some operations can take many minutes to complete. Therefore, it is up to you to update the tool paths when necessary. Similarly, when you specify a clearance line in Turning, the coordinate data is saved, but modification of the line is not reflected in the operations.
MCS
There are two coordinate systems which are unique to Manufacturing: the Machine Coordinate System and the Reference Coordinate System.
The Machine Coordinate System is the base location for all subsequent tool path output points. This allows you to move the Work Coordinate System (WCS) independently. If you move the MCS, you re-establish the base location for the subsequent tool path output points."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/opt_avail_temp,NX Manufacturing templates,"Templates contain pre-set options and dialog box layouts that are customized for specific tasks. Manufacturing contains setup templates, group templates, and operation templates.
The setup template defines the available Type options and groups that initially appear in the Operation Navigator, the Create Operation dialog box, and the Create Group dialog boxes.
You must specify the setup template when you enter the Manufacturing application for the very first time with any part. After that, the setup template is always associated with the part.
In the Create Geometry, Create Program, Create Method, Create Operation, and Create Tool dialog boxes, the Type list displays the available group templates.
In the Create Operation dialog box, the Operation Subtype group displays the available operation templates."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid924223,"CAM and NX assemblies — setups, machines, tools, and devices","When you create a native NX CAM setup, we recommend that you use the master model concept, as described under Quick Links the link at the right side of this page.
When you add tools, devices, or a machine tool assembly, to your setup, NX uses the assemblies concept to keep track of files that should be displayed with your part. The files are treated like assembly components.
As a CAM user, you do not need to complete assemblies training to use this largely automatic functionality. You do need to be aware of some assemblies basics.
Assembly Load Options
When native NX opens a part that has components, the components are found by one of the following methods:
From Folder
As Saved
From Search Folders
The default option is From Folder. If you do not change this default, NX does not initially find machine tool assemblies, and sometimes it does not find tools or devices. You may see warning messages that relate this information.
You can accept these warnings when they appear.
Opening your CAM setup after it was saved and closed
When you open a CAM setup part, when NX Manufacturing starts, it automatically searches the folders that are represented by the following variables:
UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_INSTALLED_MACHINES_DIR
UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TOOL_DIR
UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_DEVICE_DIR
Because of this additional search, after you acknowledge the warning, your machine tool and other tools and devices are displayed."

This works for files from Solid Edge and other CAD products.
It is a best practice for designers to replace as little geometry as possible when they modify designs. If a designer deletes existing geometry and creates new geometry, increased associativity failures will occur. Associativity fails when:
Faces from the original design are replaced with new ones.
The part has new geometry that did not exist in the original design.
When associativity fails, to correct it, you must re-select the geometry for the geometry group or for individual operations."

Is initialized from pre-defined setup parts (templates) in a CAM session.
The template selected determines which operation types and subtypes are available.
Stores all of your CAM data in a file. The setup can be in the same file as the part you are cutting, or in a separate assembly file.
Consists of all operations, their resulting tool paths, and the environment in which the operations are created. This includes programs and parameters for tooling, geometry and cutting methods.
Promotes standardization as it can be saved as a template and reused.
The setup starts with a part model. The requirements vary with part complexity:
Simple parts may not need additional geometry for programming purposes.
You can add a setup to the part file to create a simple setup file. (non-assembly)
More complex parts may need a fixture to add clarification.
Create a setup assembly file that references the geometry to machine as a component. This is the recommended approach, and lets you add the blank, clamps, tooling, or other components as needed.
Very complex parts may need machine tools and NX Machine Tool Simulation (NX MTS) as part of the setup. You may need to stop for inspections, heat treatments or other non-machining steps, to rotate the part to machine a different side, or move the part to a different machine.
If necessary, you can create multiple setups for the different machining conditions.

https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_setup_init_setup,Initializing the CAM setup,"How you create the CAM setup depends on whether you are in a native NX or Teamcenter environment.
In native NX, there are several ways to create the CAM setup for your part:
Open the part to machine, then let the software create the setup assembly. This is the easiest and recommended approach.
For more control over how the part is initially positioned in the assembly, open the part to machine and:
Choose File tab→New→Model tab→Assembly. Add the part to machine as a component and position it. Make the assembly the work part, then start Manufacturing.
If the part does not require a setup assembly, you can create a setup in the file containing the part to machine.
If you want to add the part to machine later, create an empty setup assembly. Either:
Choose File tab→New→Manufacturing tab→Blank.
Choose File tab→New→Model tab→Assembly, then start Manufacturing.
Note:
If + ZM is not oriented correctly for your part, either:
Go to Assemblies and reorient the component.
Reorient the MCS.
If you are in a Teamcenter environment, or if your configuration includes a LIBRARY_SETUP_TEMPLATE, such as cam_library, then the software classifies and retrieves the setups through NX Library. See Data Management for more information.
Note:
Do not switch between Teamcenter and native NX during a session. Start Manufacturing in either Teamcenter or native NX, with the matching CAM configuration specified.
To work in both environments, you must have two ways to start Manufacturing, so that the matching CAM configuration is already specified. This can be done with batch files, or with multiple .env files.
After you initialize the setup:
Rename or create additional programs to manage your operations (roughing vs. finishing).
Retrieve tools from the library or create new tools.
Define geometry (workpiece, MCS, boundaries).
Use existing methods or create new ones.

Each dialog prompts for information that is common for the whole setup, such as the coordinate system or geometry. Select OK to continue to the next dialog, or Back to return to the last dialog. All the setup and process assistants work in a manner similar to that described in the following example:
Example
Open a part without a setup and select the Manufacturing application. To create the setup, select the Mill_Contour configuration, then select the mold_sequences setup and Initialize.
The system displays a welcome dialog, and the process assistant leads you through the following steps:
This image displays the parts of the setup you will define this example.
Select the machine coordinate system.
In the dialog, select an MCS icon and define the machine coordinate system for this program. The system stores this information in the MCS group.
Select the clearance plane.
Define a safe clearance above the part where the system can use rapid motion.
Select the Clearance checkbox and then select Specify.
Select or display the part geometry.
If Display is active, select it to see what part geometry the system has selected. The system automatically selects all the geometry named PART. If this is what you want, select OK.
If Display is not active, click Select and select your part geometry. This is usually a solid body of the entire core or cavity. The system needs this information even if you only cut some of the faces. This is to keep the tool from gouging or colliding with the rest of the part body. This is also used by Visualize and the Gouge Checker.
Select or display the blank geometry.
If Display is active, select it to see what blank geometry the system has selected. The system automatically selects all geometry named BLANK. If this is what you want, select OK.
If Display is not active, click Select and select your blank geometry. Select a solid body or use the auto block or auto distance options. This represents what your part looks like at the beginning of the setup, before being machined.
Select OK. The system displays an information window and a message that you have completed the setup. The setup contains the MCS and workpiece as well as several tools and methods that are common in mold machining. The information window gives you two choices: either change templates and create operations as you normally do, or select the Create Geometry icon to create predefined sequences.
The next section explains how to create predefined sequences:
Creating a Machining Sequence"
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_setup_creat_mach_seq,Create a machining sequence,"Choose Home tab→Insert group→Create Geometry .
In the Create Geometry dialog box, from the Type list, select mold_sequences.
Note:
If mold_sequences is not available, choose  Menu→Preferences→Manufacturing→Configuration and select the mill_contour configuration.
Set the following:
Geometry Subtype = SEQUENCE_ZLEVEL
Location = Workpiece
This tells NX to use the zlevel sequence to machine the workpiece defined in the setup.
NX displays a dialog that begins another process assistant. This process assistant leads you through creating a machining sequence as shown in the example below.
Example
This image displays the parts of the sequence you will define in the following example.
To machine the entire part, select OK without selecting a cut area. The system then tries to cut all the faces on the part. If you only want to machine some of the part, click Select. This option selects the faces or surface region that you want to machine with this sequence.
The system stores the faces or surface regions selected here in a Mill_Area group. For example, use this if you want to cut the faces in the molding area, without cutting the parting line or other faces.
Select the contour cut area.
Select the contour trim area.
To use trim boundaries, click Select and select the trim boundaries. You can select the outside edges of the part with trim set to outside. This will prevent the tool from making any extra motion outside the part.
Trim boundaries allow you to contain the tool path, inside or outside of selected areas. Use this to limit cutting to just specific areas of the cut area or part, or to avoid some areas. If you don't select trim boundaries, the system tries to cut the entire cut area or part.
Select optional operations.
This dialog contains a list of optional operations. For example, there is a flowcut operation that you should select if your part has blends with less than a radius of .125 inch (3 mm). If your part doesn't have small corners like these, you don't need to select the checkbox for this operation.
For very fine finishing, there is a zigzag fine operation that cuts with very small stepovers. If you want a finishing operation like this, select the checkbox for this operation.
To view all the operations you created in this group, display the Geometry View in the Operation Navigator and expand the ZLEVEL_SEQUENCE group. Look at the operations and make any changes before generating.
For example, if you need smaller tolerances for roughing, display the Method View and edit the MOLD_ROUGH method. If you want to use a different tool for the pre-roughing, display the Tool View and move that operation to a new tool.
To generate the tool paths without examining the operations first, select the Generate Tool Paths checkbox and click OK.
Generate.
Additional Sequences
You have now created one machining sequence for some or all of the workpiece. If needed, you can create more sequences for other cut areas on this workpiece, or for another workpiece.
Customizing
The process assistant is an aid to help you create a setup and the sequences of operations. Once you use the process assistant you can edit these operations to fit them to your needs. You can also delete or add operations to change the process.
If you are making the same edits and changes to the same operations after using the process assistant, you should consider customizing the operations in the template, or creating your own template. Remember that these templates are updated with each release, so make a copy of your customization."

This integration promotes efficient and more accurate programming experience, giving you continuous access to machine capabilities without requiring additional settings or redundant information.
The machine
You can use Machine Powered Programming capabilities in the NX Manufacturing application only when your machine kinematics are enabled with Machine Powered Programming. Machines are available on Post Hub or you can build one using the Machine Kit Wizard dialog box in the Machine Tool Builder application with the help of available templates.
Using a machine enabled with Machine Powered Programming in NX Manufacturing improves the user interface and changes user experience regarding the tool handling and machine interactions during CAM programming.
Note:
Currently, NX Machine Powered Programming is available only for a milling machine that includes a single channel and a single kinematic chain.
Machine Kinematics
To use machine kinematics enabled for Machine Powered Programming, you must define some additional parameters. You can see those parameters in the Create Machine Component/Edit Machine Component dialog box in the Classify Component group.
Instant machine preview with Display Tool in Machine option
Use the Display Tool in Machine in the Ribbon bar to activate an instant machine preview at any time during tool path creation or editing, and outside in combination with Tool Path Animation or Select Tool Path. Display Tool in Machine is available in CAM setups exclusively with a Machine Powered Programming enabled machine kit.
The option is meant to help you create tool paths more quickly and improve quality. You should use the machine preview with Display Tool in Machine to get a quick visual impression of the current machining situation. However, to ensure a collision-free and optimal machining process, it is recommended to use the machine code-based simulation as a final check.
Instant machine preview with Display Tool in Machine option during operation edit
To use the Display Tool in Machine option during the operation edit, go to Manufacturing Preference - Operations Tab on the Operations tab, and in the Edit Operation group, you can select the Allow Display Tool in Machine option.
When you set this preference, the Display Tool in Machine button is displayed, allowing visualization of the tool with the machine during editing. This gives you an animated preview of the machine's interaction with the tool paths.
The Display Tool in Machine option is turned off when you open an edit operation dialog box. Then the view switches to the stationary part. When you leave the operation edit dialog box, the Display Tool in Machine option is again available.
Operation Navigator Machine Tool View
When you use a machine kit that is enabled with Machine Powered Programming in a CAM setup, that changes the scope for the Machine Tool View in the Operation Navigator. To specify the machining view of the tool, you assign the tool to the carrier location where it is used during the machining process. Pockets are not available and tools can be assigned to an available carrier or carriers, or to Unused Items. You cannot place tools outside of a carrier or in Unused Items.
To adjust a Tool Number, Adjust Register, or Cutcom Register value, you must change it manually in the tool edit dialog box. This ensures that when you create a new tool, the tool number is unique.
Note:
This Machine Tool View is available only for setups that use Machine Powered Programming enabled machine kits.
Caveats
Retrieve Machine or Device from Library
Additional devices like chucks or vices retrieved from the NX CAM device library are not supported with Machine Powered Programming capabilities. To use such devices, you must add them as assembly components to the CAM setup, or build them directly into the machine kinematics mode.
Mixtures of machines or devices with or without the Machine Powered Programming option are prohibited. NX displays a warning.
Example:
Before replacing an old machine with a new machine, make sure that no geometry is assigned in the Kinematic Model setup elements, that is, in Setup configurator. Part, blank, or fixture geometry should be assigned via the Physical Workpiece option in the Workpiece Geometry dialog box.

The Machine Tool Navigator - Setup Configurator is not supported with Machine Powered Programming enabled machines.
Simulate Machine – Tool Path Based
Manufacturing setups using Machine Powered Programming machines cannot use the Tool Path Based Simulation option from the Simulate Machine command.
Verify Tool Path
It is not recommended to use the Verify Tool Path command in conjunction with the Display Tool in Machine option. A correct machine preview cannot be guaranteed.
Tool Display Options
Tool Display settings are not applied when you use Display Tool in Machine.
Dynamic Tool Display
When you dynamically move the spindle, this can interfere with the active Display Tool in Machine and lead to unwanted machine preview behavior. We recommend that you turn off Display Tool in Machine when dynamic tool display dialog boxes are open.
Tool Path Animation with solid assembly tools in conjunction with Display Tool in Machine
No tool is displayed on the spindle when the part files of the solid tools are not loaded. That is, a part file is not stored on the machine.
Asymmetric Tools - such as Back Counter Sinking
Tool paths with asymmetric tools that require a spindle position, such as back counter sinks, are not supported and will result in an incorrect tool position when Display Tool in Machine is active."

Generates one tool path.
Contains the information required to generate the tool path: geometry, tool, and machining parameters.
For each operation that you generate and accept, the software saves the information used to generate the tool path in the current part. This information includes the postprocessor command set, display data, and the coordinate system of definition.
You could specify all the required information within each operation. However, it is more efficient to specify parameters once and store the information where it can be used by multiple operations. Store only the most specific parameters, such as engage, retract, and stepover, in the operation.
Example:
To repeat similar operations on two cavities, you can put the cavity geometry in two groups, and then create or copy the same operations under each group. This saves you from duplicating your efforts."

Each operation subtype is set by default to a specific drilling cycle that is appropriate for the operation. Most drilling operations let you specify a different drilling cycle and the type of motion output: one CYCLE/ statement or individual GOTO statements.
Spot Drilling
Drills to the default depth value specified in the template. If the default tool depth would violate the part, NX reduces the depth to a safe value.
Drilling
Drills with a basic Drill machine cycle, by default.
Deep Hole Drilling
Uses drilling cycles that include the spindle, coolant, and feed rate controls that are required to drill deep holes. The in-process feature volume identifies any pilot hole or cross holes that have been previously machined.
Countersinking
Drills a diameter larger than the hole diameter. If a chamfer is not modeled on the hole feature, NX estimates an initial value.
Back Countersinking
Countersinks the back end of through holes using a tool with the neck offset from the centerline of the shank. On the engage and retract moves, NX shifts the tool off-center as required to safely pass through the hole.
If a chamfer is not modeled on the hole feature, NX estimates an initial value.
Tapping
Cuts threads in holes using a tapping tool. The major diameter of the tapping tool must equal the diameter of the feature to cut. All features to cut must have the same diameter.
Sequential Drilling
Drills a sequence of coaxial holes. Uses drilling cycles that include additional feed rate controls for crossing voids. The in-process feature volume identifies the voids."

These fixed-axis planar milling operations cut planar faces on solid bodies to efficiently machine prismatic parts and features.
Groove Milling
The Groove Milling processor cuts planar faces on solid bodies to efficiently machine linear grooves and slots using T-Cutters.
Face Milling
The Face Milling processor cuts planar faces on solid bodies. For example, pads on a casting.
Planar Milling
Operation subtypes that use the Planar Milling processor follow 2D boundaries to remove material along vertical walls, or walls that are parallel to the tool axis. Planar Milling removes material in planar levels that are perpendicular to a fixed tool axis. The areas on the part to be machined can include planar islands and planar floors that are normal to the tool axis.
Planar Profiling (Planar Milling, 2D Single profiling type)
The Planar Milling processor with the 2D Single profiling type, cuts a single profiling pass along a part boundary.
Planar Milling, 3D Single profiling type
Operation subtypes that use the Planar Milling processor with the 3D Single profiling type, cut one or more profiling passes along 3D part geometry. The depth is determined by the edges or curves in the boundary. These operation subtypes are often used for trim dies.
Planar Text
The Planar Text processor engraves drafting text directly on a planar surface. Drafting text can include part numbers and mold cavity ID numbers.
Cavity Milling
Operation subtypes that use the Cavity Milling processor remove large volumes of material. Cavity Milling removes material in planar levels that are perpendicular to a fixed tool axis. Part Geometry can be planar or contoured. Cavity Milling is ideal for rough-cutting parts, such as dies, castings, and forgings.
Plunge Milling
The PLUNGE_MILLING processor cuts vertically to take advantage of the increased rigidity when a tool moves along the Z-axis. Plunge Milling efficiently roughs out large volumes of blank, and lets you finish hard-to-reach deep walls with long slender tool assemblies.

The Optimize Feed Rates options vary feed rates to maintain a constant material removal rate. When the feed rate for an operation is not optimized, the feed rate remains constant as the actual material removal rate varies.
To optimize feed rates, NX does the following:
Calculates a nominal material removal rate (nMRR) for the operation from the values that you enter in the following dialog boxes:
Optimize Feed Rate or Feeds and Speeds dialog box
Nominal Cut Width
Nominal Cut Depth
Feeds and Speeds
Cutting feed rates
[Milling tool]
Tool parameters
NX applies a correction factor for tool shapes that remove less material than the amount calculated from the Nominal Cut Width and Nominal Cut Depth values.
Calculates the real material removal rate (rMRRi) from the in-process workpiece at intervals defined by the Length Interval value entered in the Optimize Feed Rate or the Feeds and Speeds dialog box.
Calculates the optimized feed rate (oFRi) for each length interval.
oFR = Cutting feed rate * (nMRR/rMRR).
Limits the optimized feed rate applied to within the range defined by the Feed Rate Range values entered in the Optimize Feed Rate or the Feeds and Speeds dialog box.
Optimized feed rate example
nMRR
Nominal material removal rate calculation:
Nominal Cut Width = 0.25 inches
Nominal Cut Depth = 0.10 inches
Cut cutting feed rate = 30 ipm
The tool is an end mill without a taper or end radius. A tool correction factor is not required.
nMRR = .75 in3/min
rMRRi
Real material removal rate for two sample intervals:
Length Interval = 0.4 inches
Length interval 0 to 0.4 inches: rMRR1 = .40 in3/min
Length interval 0.4 to 0.8 inches: rMRR2 = .95 in3/min
oFRi
Optimized feed rate calculations for the two sample intervals:
oFR1 = 30 ipm * (.75/.40) = 56.3 ipm
oFR2 = 30 ipm * (.75/.95) = 23.7 ipm
Limits
Optimized feed rate limits applied to the entire toolpath:
Feed Rate Range = Percent
Minimum Feed (%Cut) = 50
Maximum Feed (%Cut) = 200
The slowest Cut feed rate applied to a tool path interval is 15 ipm. The fastest Cut feed rate is 60 ipm.

Surface Speed (sfm) (smm)
Specifies the speed of the cutting tip as it moves across or into the part. The speed is measured at the cutting edge of each tooth.
The units of speed are either surface feet or meters per minute. It is particularly useful to use a Surface Speed value in boring operations where a single tip does the work.
Feed per Tooth
Specifies the amount of material that each tooth removes. The tooth movement is based on the spindle rotation rate and the feed rate of the tool. The units of measurement can be inches or millimeters.
Tip:
Enter the Surface Speed or Spindle Speed value before you change the Feed per Tooth value.
More
Reset from Table
Supports the legacy method for recommending appropriate Surface Speed and Feed per Tooth values using part material, tool material, cut method, and cut depth parameters that it extracts from predefined tables. Depending on the operation type, the Surface Speed and Feed per Tooth values are used to calculate the spindle speed and some cutting feed rates.
Note:
The predefined tables contain parameters only after you specify them.
The currently preferred method is to use machining data libraries and the Set Machining Data option."

Spindle Speed (RPM)
Sets a mom variable for the spindle status. Some users require this variable to generate custom output.
The variable that is set is not used by the example post processors, and it does not affect tool path output.
Spindle Speed (RPM)
Specifies the rotation speed of the tool.
If you change the value, Calculate Speeds and Feeds based on this value in the same row becomes active. The software uses the Spindle Speed value to calculate the Surface Speed and Feed per Tooth values.
Retract Speed (%)
Available for drilling operations. Lets you increase or decrease the spindle speed on the retract move.

Output Mode
RPM = revolutions per minute.
SFM = surface feet per minute.
SMM = surface meters per minute.

CLW = output the code for clockwise rotation.
CCLW = output to code for couinterclockwise rotation.
None = do not output a rotation direction code, if the post supports no direction code output.
Outputs the NC code for clockwise or counterclockwise rotation, or suppresses the output of a direction code if the post allows this.
Range Status
Controls whether the Range Status box is available. This governs the output of the RANGE,n command to set a spindle speed range. You can enter any value or keyword that you have defined in your post.
The classic NX Post output is either a numeric value, LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH, where the text is interpreted as follows:
LOW = 1
MEDIUM = 2

Output Mode
Specifies the postprocessed output mode.
RPM = revolutions per minute.
SFM = surface feet per minute.
SMM = surface meters per minute.
Spindle Speed
Available when RPM is selected in the Output Mode list.
When selected, the Spindle Speed box is available to specify the spindle rotation in RPM.
The following options are available when SFM or SMM is selected in the Output Mode list.
Surface Speed (sfm)
Specifies the surface feed per minute in the specified units, meters or feet.
Maximum RPM
When selected, the Maximum RPM box is available to specify the output of the maximum RPM of which the machine is capable.
When you are performing a facing operation with constant surface speed, the calculated spindle speed increases as the tool moves closer to the centerline. The Maximum RPM value limits the speed that is output to the specified maximum value. The value is also used for calculations of feed rates with constant surface speed in the local return by time calculations.
Preset RPM
When selected, the Preset RPM box is available to specify the exact spindle speed to be output. This is used as an alternate means to manage local return by time calculations when the cutting tool is close to the centerline.
Direction
In NX2206 and later versions, the direction of rotation is determined by the view from the part to the tool.
In Post Configurator postprocessors, the Spindle configuration object Lathe Spindle Direction Definition default setting of Normal corresponds to the CLW direction or the CCLW direction set in the operation dialog box. The Reverse option reverses the rotation specified in the operation. The Lathe Spindle Direction Definition is output in the new MOM variable mom_sys_turning_spindle_direction_mode and complements the existing MOM variable mom_spindle_direction.
Note:
If you use a Post Configurator postprocessor created prior to NX 2206, you do not need to change to your spindle direction setting in the postprocessor. Leave the Lathe Spindle Direction Definition option as Reverse. This includes a postprocessor that is updated with a library from NX 2206 or later.
Automatic
Sets the correct spindle rotation direction based on the side of the centerline where the tool insert is located. The calculated direction appears beside Automatic, as shown:

Cut
Sets the feed rate for tool movement while the cutter is in contact with part geometry.
Rapid
When you view the tool path listing or CLSF output, note that RAPID commands apply only to the next GOTO point in the tool path and CLSF. Subsequent moves use the last specified feed rate.
Output
G0 — Rapid Mode
Sets rapid motions to use the machine’s non-interpolated motion.
Writes the RAPID command into the tool path and CLSF.
G1 — Feed Mode
Sets rapid motions to use the machine’s interpolated motion at the specified rapid feed rate. Use this for machines that would otherwise make dog-leg rapid moves. You specify the rapid feed rate value and units using the Rapid Feed option.
More
For all motion types in this group, you can specify no units, units per revolution, units per minute, and percent of the specified cut feed.
For all motions except First Cut and Step Over, you can also specify a rapid feed.
Approach
Sets the feed rate for tool movement from the start point to the engage position.
Approach motion at rapid feed
Approach motion between cut levels
Approach motion at a feed rate
Engage
Sets the feed rate for tool movement from the engage position to the initial cutting position. This feed rate also applies to the return move when the tool returns to the workpiece after lifts.
First Cut
Sets the feed rate when a first-cut motion is generated. This motion occurs when the cutter diameter is embedded in the material to be cut. Examples include:
The first cut in a volume of material that is not approached in several smaller cutting stages, such as the first cut in a pocket, or the first cut within a boundary.
The first cut when the cutter moves through a narrow passage or slot, or into an acute-angled concave corner.
Passes where the cutter is not embedded use the cut feed rate.
Operations that contain only profiling passes, and the Standard Drive cut pattern, do not generate First Cut motions.
The Follow Part and the Follow Periphery Outward cut patterns apply different rules to First Cut feed rates.
When you first specify a First Cut feed rate value that is different from the Cut feed rate, NX recalculates the tool path and marks the appropriate sections as First Cut motions. Subsequent changes to the First Cut feed rate do not require recalculation of the tool path.
You can specify a different tool path color to verify which moves are calculated to be first cut moves.
Stepover
Sets the feed rate for the cutter as it moves from one pass to the next.
Traversal
Sets the feed rate for fast horizontal non-cutting tool motion when the Transfer Method option on the Engage/Retract menu is set to Previous Level.
This feed rate is used only when the tool is at a vertical clearance distance above the uncut surface and the horizontal clearance distance away from any islands or walls. This position and feed rate combination protects the part during tool transits where the tool can be moved without having to be lifted to the clearance plane.
Retract
Sets the feed rate for tool movement to the retract position from the final tool path cutting position.
Departure
Sets the feed rate for tool movement for the retract move, traversal moves, or the return move. The first return move above the retract point can also be a departure move.
Units
These options change the units setting for all cutting and noncutting motion types.
Set Non-Cut Units and Set Cut Units
none
No units are output.
ipr or mmpr
Units per revolution are output.
ipm or mmpm
Units per minute are output.
Rapid
The RAPID command is output.
%Cut
A percentage of the cut feed is calculated and output.
  Optimize Feed Rate when Generating
Optimizes the feed rates immediately after you generate the tool path. This option automates the result you achieve when you use the Operation Navigator to optimize feed rates.
This option also updates feed rates when the amount of material being removed changes. NX uses a 3D IPW model or blank geometry to calculate new feed rates.
Use this option to obtain more accurate feed rates and save on the time taken to remove material."

Each view organizes the same set of operations based on the theme of the view: the order of operations within the program, the tools used, the geometry machined, or the machining methods used.
Use the Operation Navigator to:
Cut or copy and paste operations, programs, methods, or geometry within the setup for a part or between setups for different parts.
Note:
If you select a geometry or program group to copy, the operations are also copied.
If you select a method or tool group to copy, operations are not copied.
Drag and drop groups and operations within the setup for a part.
Specify common parameters in one group location, such as the Workpiece geometry group. The parameters are passed down (inherited) by operations within the group.
Turn Inheritance on for specific parameters.
Display the tool path and geometry of an operation in the graphics window to quickly see what is defined and which areas are machined.
Display the In Process Workpiece (IPW) of a milling or turning operation.
Within the Operation Navigator:
A tree structure controls the relationships between groups and operations. The position of a group or operation determines how parameters are passed down (inherited).
Individual columns display different types of information. You can change the display of columns using the configurations available in the sub menu of Column Configuration.
You have the ability to view multiple parts at the same time, each in its own graphics window, within the same NX session.
If you expand or collapse the tree structure in the navigator, that structure continues to display the same way if you change to another part, and then return to the first part. The vertical position of the cursor in the tree structure is also saved.

If the assembly is not fully loaded, NX then fully loads the necessary components. If any of these components were modified, the status of the operations associated to the geometry of these components will be Regenerate .
To ensure that the setup assembly is fully loaded before you copy and paste operations, do the following:
Choose File tab→Options→Assembly Load Options.
The Assembly Load Options dialog box is displayed.
In the Scope group, set the parameters as shown.
Load = All Components
Option = Fully Load

Displays the color of the material that remains after the operation has been played.
Total Time
Displays the total of the cutting and secondary times for your programs.
Note:
The machining times are generated by the Calculate Machining Times command. In order to use the command, you must have a machine tool and blank geometry defined in the CAM setup because the times are calculated using the NX MTS function. If the times have not been calculated, or have become invalid, the times are not displayed in the columns.
Cutting Time
Displays the total of the material and air cutting times for your programs. The material time is when the cutter is engaged in the IPW. The air time is when the tool is not removing material. (See the note for Total Time.)
You can display the material and air cutting times using:
Material Cutting Time
Air Cutting Time
Note:
You can set the default Detect Air Cutting Time in the Manufacturing Preferences dialog box→Operation tab to calculate the material and air portions of the Cutting Time.
Secondary Time
Displays the total of the positioning, dragging, delay, wait, and tool change times for your programs. (See the note for Total Time.)
Positioning Time

View
Description
Program Order View
Organizes operations by the order in which they are executed on the machine tool. Each program group represents a separate program file that is output to the postprocessor or CLSF.
Sorting of columns is disabled in this view.
For more information, see Program Groups.
Machine Tool View
Organizes operations by the cutting tools used and displays all the tools retrieved from the tool library or created in the current setup. You can also organize cutting tools by turrets on a lathe or by tool type on a mill.
Geometry View
Organizes operations by machining geometry and MCS orientation.
Each geometry group displays operations by the order in which they are executed on the machine tool.
Sorting of columns is disabled in this view.
For more information, see Geometry Groups.
Machining Method View
Organizes operations by common machining applications which share the same parameter values, such as roughing, semi-finishing, and finishing.
For more information, see Method Groups.
Add program view
Allows you to add up to two program order view. This is very helpful in multiple spindle machines
Remove program view
Removes your additional program order view.
Each view:
Organizes the operations into groups that control relevant parameters. The contents of a group are inherited by the groups and operations below it in the Navigator tree. The groups display whether they are actually used in the NC program or not.
For example: If a tool is used, it has one or more operations below it in the Machine Tool View. Unused tools do not have an operation below the tool.
Contains an Unused Items folder to store items that you might need later. Generating operations in the Unused Items folder does not update the In Process Workpiece.
When you select an operation in a view, then change views, the groups are expanded to show the selected operation in each view. You can also look at the Dependencies panel to see where an operation is located in all four views.
You can switch from one view of the Operation Navigator to another by clicking the appropriate button on the Top Border bar.
Note:
When you change the order of the operations in a geometry group in the Geometry view, remember to check how your changes have affected the sequence of operations in the Program Order view before outputting your program. For more information see Operation Order.
The groups that initially appear in the Operation Navigator are defined by the setup template specified the first time you start the Manufacturing application for a model. For more information, see Available CAM session setups."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_use_prog_view,Using the Program Order View to Create Your NC Program,"When you have viewed the Program Order View and seen the order in which the operations are going to be machined, you can analyze the situation and decide if it is arranged in the most efficient way. If you decide that some operations need to be rearranged to make the program more efficient, it is easy to rearrange the operations in the Program Order View. For example, if are trying to reduce tool changes you can either choose to change the order of the operations, or change the tool that the operation uses. Changing the order of the operations is most easily done in the Program Order View. Changing the tool the operation uses is most easily done in the Tool View. This is because the Program Order View groups the operations together in chronological order and the Tool View groups the operations by the tool.
Note:
The Program Order view will always be synchronized when moving operations in the other views of the Operation Navigator."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_setup_using_geom,Using Geometry View to Enhance Your NC Programs,"If you want to plan your NC program based on geometry, use the Geometry View instead of the Program Order View. You can then organize the setup by geometric feature.
For example, you can create a geometry group for Pocket A that includes a rough mill operation and a finish mill operation. You do the same for Pocket B. In the Program Order View, you change the order of the operation so that you rough both pockets first then finish both pockets. In the Geometry View your operations are organized by the geometry they machine, but in the Program Order View, those same operations are organized in the order they are output.
If you create your NC program in the Program Order View, you can still use the Geometry View to help you edit the NC program. Use the Geometry View to evaluate the operations used in each geometry group and decide if the arrangement is the most efficient. Since the Geometry View groups the operations together according to their geometry group, the Geometry View can be used to easily move or copy an operation from one geometry group to another.
Always check how the changes you have made in any view affect the Program Order View, as this is the view that contains the sequence of the operations for output.
Operation Order
The order of the operations within the geometry groups is linked from the Geometry View to the Program Order View. If you change the order of operations within a geometry group in the Geometry View, those changes are also reflected in the Program Order View.  
For example, if a hole_geom group contains center drill, drill, and tap, those three operations must occur in that order at each hole. Other operations in other geometry groups can occur in between, but for any hole in the group, center drill must precede drill which must precede the tap.
For reordering to occur in the program group and be maintained in the Program Order View, the operations:
Must be in the same geometry group
Must be in the same program group
Must appear in sequential order
If there are operations from different programs between your ordered operations, then the order will not be maintained in the Program Order View. For example, if there are three operations in one geometry group, but the third operation is in a different program, and operation 1 is moved to a position after operation 2, the order will be updated in the program view. However, if operation 1 is moved to after operation 3, the order in the Program Order View will not be updated, because operation 3 is in a different program.
The relative order of consecutive operations within a geometry group is maintained in the Program Order View, the order of the geometry groups in the Geometry View is not.  In other words, the order of operations in different geometry groups is not automatically maintained in the Program Order View.
The Tool and Method Views have no effect on the Program Order View.
Operations in the Unused Items group are not considered when determining the order between the Geometry and the Program Order Views."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/setup_using_tool_view,Using the Tool View to Enhance Your NC Program,"When you have viewed the Tool View and seen all the operations in which the tools are used, you can analyze the situation and decide if it is arranged in the most efficient way. Use this view to change the tool the operation uses, by moving the operation to a different tool parent. Since the Tool View groups the operations together by tool name, it allows you to quickly locate the tool you are searching for. Therefore, making changes in your operation relating to the tool are most easily performed in the Tool View. For example if you modified a tool, you would use the Tool View to see all of the operations that used that tool, and regenerate them to update their tool paths.
The graphic below is an example of the Tool View. In the furthest left hand column, under Name, you can see all the tools that are in the part. You can also see that only two of these tools are actually used by operations. You can tell this by the plus or minus sign that is to the left of the tool name.
In this example Tool UGTI0203_013 has been expanded to show the operation in which it is used. If you decide you want tool UGT0203_008 to perform this operation (FLOWCUT_SINGLE) you can drag and drop the operation into the correct place. Select the operation and drag it to the tool you want to use in that operation. Let go of the mouse, and that tool is now used in that operation.
After moving an operation, status is set to regenerate, so you need to regenerate the operation to update the tool path.
Tool UGTI0203_017 is collapsed. Expand it and see the operation(s) listed below it. These are the operations in which it is used.

In the Method View the system displays the operations grouped together according to their machining method (rough, finish, semi-finish). This organization makes it easy to manipulate the method choice within the operations. Be sure to always check how the changes you have made in any view affect the Program Order View as this is the view that contains the sequence of operations.
Use this view to change the method information for several operations at once. For example, to change the cut color for all Mill-Rough operations, edit the Mill_Rough Method, and change the display options. Now all the operations in that method inherit the new colors. This is easier than changing the display options in each operation."

The General tab contains an edit field. In the edit field you can rename the current node. Changing the name and hitting either OK or APPLY will change the name of the current node. Before the new name is applied, a check will be performed to see if it is valid. If it is not valid a message box informs you that the name is not valid.
Note:
Note that the edit field is insensitive if the object properties dialog is invoked on a system object which cannot be renamed (for example Unused Items) .
The information icon is also available on the General tab. This icon displays an information window on the currently selected operation or group.
The Attributes tab allows you to view the attributes associated with the node. It also allows you to edit, add, or delete attributes.
Suppressed Status
When you choose Object → Suppressed Status, the Operation Navigator will show the current suppression status (suppressed or non) of all operations within the selected groups. This information updates when the Suppressed Status changes."

Set Machining Data
Sets parameters to match the Machining Data Library values.
Calculates feeds and speeds for the first operation selected, and then applies those values to all the operations. Does not change depth of cut or stepover values.
For more information see Set Machining Data overview.
Surface Speed
Specifies the cutting speed of the tool measured at the cutting edge of each tooth in surface feet or meters per minute.
The software uses Surface Speed to calculate Spindle Speed and Feed per Tooth. Changing this value recalculates the other parameters.
Tip:
Surface Speed and Spindle Speed are different methods for specifying the tool's cutting speed.
Feed per Tooth
Measures the amount of material removed per tooth in inches or millimeters. The software uses this value to calculate the Cut feed rate.
Changing this value recalculates the Cut feed rate.
Tip:
Enter the Surface Speed or Spindle Speed value before changing the Feed per Tooth value.
Output
Wire EDM only
Feed Rates
Specifies the type of moves to output:
None
(Default) Does not output any feed rate control command to the tool path. Use None for machines that control feed rates by means of the machine power setting.
Rapid Only
Does not output a FEDRAT/ post command. Use Rapid only for machines that need a faster speed for non-cutting moves.
All Moves
Outputs a FEDRAT/ statement for non-zero, positive feed rate values. Use for machines with full feed rate control capability.
Spindle Speed
The software uses Spindle Speed to calculate Surface Speed and Feed per Tooth. Changing this value recalculates the other parameters.
Spindle Speed (rpm)
Sets a mom variable for the spindle status. Some users require this variable to generate custom output.
The variable that is set is not used by the example post processors, and it does not affect tool path output.
Spindle Speed
Specifies the cutting speed of the tool measured in revolutions per minute.
If you change the value, Calculate Speeds and Feeds based on this value in the same row becomes active. The software uses the Spindle Speed value to calculate the Surface Speed and Feed per Tooth values.
Tip:
Surface Speed and Spindle Speed are different methods of specifying the tool's cutting speed.
Output Mode
RPM
Defines the spindle speed in revolutions per minute.
SFM
Defines the spindle speed in surface feet per minute.
SMM
Defines the spindle speed in surface meters per minute.
Direction
CLW = output the code for clockwise rotation.
CCLW = output to code for couinterclockwise rotation.
None = do not output a rotation direction code, if the post supports no direction code output.
Outputs the NC code for clockwise or counterclockwise rotation, or suppresses the output of a direction code if the post allows this.
Range Status
Activates the Range box.
The Range box allows you to enter the spindle speed range. Spindle range is normally programmed as a numeric value; however, LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH can be used as follows:
LOW = 1
MEDIUM = 2
HIGH = 2 if there are only 2 ranges
HIGH = 3 if there are more than 2 ranges
Text Status
Specifies text to add to the LOAD or TURRET command during CLSF output.

The mirrored operations are associative copies that optionally let you reverse the tool path while maintaining the cut direction and thread hand or cut angle.
NX applies the Maintain Cut Direction or Maintain Cut Angle option when the mirrored operation is generated. If you select the Generate Tool Path check box, NX generates the mirrored operation for you. Otherwise, you must manually generate it.
If you change an operation parameter in the source operation, NX automatically changes the parameter in the mirrored copy.
If you change an operation parameter in the mirrored copy, it becomes an independent parameter. All of the other parameters remain associative, and the source operation is not affected.
1 Original tool path (climb cut)   2 Mirrored tool path (climb cut - reversed path)
  You can place the mirrored operations in a separate program group to post them independently from the original operations. The mirrored operations can also have their own blank geometry and MCS parent groups.
Part geometry is not required on the mirrored side because NX only uses it for visualization.
If you define a blank geometry parent for mirrored operations:
NX does not use the blank to calculate the tool path, or to verify using the 3D Dynamic options. When you generate the tool path of a mirrored operation, NX always uses the part and blank of the source operation. For IPW-aware operations, NX keeps the blank and IPW of the source and mirrored operations separate to guarantee undisturbed tool path computation for the mirrored set of operations.
NX subtracts the mirrored tool path from the blank geometry parent to show the resulting IPW only when you show the 3D workpiece.
Tip:
To show the 3D workpiece, select one or more mirrored operations, right-click and choose Workpiece→Show 3D.
Note:
The dialog box for a mirrored operation displays the parameter settings of the original operation before applying the mirror settings. Check the information in the Dependencies column to determine if NX is maintaining the cut direction and cut angle.
Operation Navigator indicators
In the Operation Navigator, in the Path column, NX clearly indicates that the new tool path is a mirrored copy of the original tool path. In the Dependencies column, NX indicates which operations are the original source operations and which operations are the mirrored copies . NX also indicates if a mirrored operation has modified parameters .
When you hover over the icon, NX lists the Mirror dialog box options applied to the operation.
When you hover over the icon, NX also lists the modified parameters that are no longer associative. All of the other parameters remain associative.

When you transform an operation:
You can move the operation. This changes the location or orientation of the operation.
You can copy the operation. This creates a new operation with its own set of parameters and tool paths.
You can make an instance of the original operation. This also creates a new operation, but it is linked to the original operation, which can save you time creating and editing the corresponding tool paths.
The new operation, copy, or instance remembers its relationship to the original operation.
Non-associative objects are mapped using the reference coordinate system (RCS) and translated with the operation. Non-associative objects include geometric parameters, such as tool axis vectors and clearance planes that are not modeled.
Associative objects created using Point, Vector, or Plane Constructor are not mapped or translated with the operation because they retain their associativity.
From and GoHome Points are not translated with the operation because they are associated with the machine tool and not the operation.

Translate
Moves the selected operations or tool paths from a reference point to a destination point, or along an incremental (Delta) distance.
Scale
Changes the size of the selected operations or tool paths relative to a reference point.
For example, if the scale factor is 2, the XC, YC, ZC coordinates are multiplied by 2.
If you enter multiple copies, the scale factor is applied to each copy. The original is scaled to create the first copy and then the scale factor is applied to the scaled copy to create the next copy and so on.
Rotate About a Point
Rotates the selected operations or tool paths around a reference line that is parallel to the ZC-axis and passes through a specified reference point. A positive rotation is in the counterclockwise direction from the positive X (or XC) axis to the positive Y (or YC) axis.
Rotate About a Line
Rotates the selected operations or tool paths around any reference line. A positive rotation is in the counterclockwise direction from the positive X (or XC) axis to the positive Y (or YC) axis.
Mirror Through a Line
Creates a mirror image of the selected operations or tool paths on the opposite side of a reference line. The distance from each Goto point to the reference line is maintained in the mirrored path.
Multiple copies are not available for this option.
For more information, see Mirror Through a Line.
Mirror Through a Plane
Creates a mirror image of the selected operations or tool paths relative to a specified plane. The distance from each Goto point to the plane is maintained in the mirrored path.
Multiple copies are not available for this option.
Circular Array
Copies the selected operations or tool paths to create a circular pattern.
You specify a reference point and the array origin point. The software places the reference point of the first element of the array at the array origin point. Each element of the array maintains the same relationship to the destination point as it had to the reference point.
Multiple copies of the array are not available.
Rectangular Array
Copies the selected operations or tool paths to create rows and columns parallel to the XC and YC axes.
You specify a reference point and the array origin point. The software places the reference point of the first element of the array at the array origin point. Each element of the array maintains the same relationship to the destination point as it had to the reference point.
Multiple copies of the array are not available.
CSYS To CSYS
Moves the selected operations or tool paths from the current coordinate system to a destination coordinate system. The transformed operations or tool paths maintain the same positions relative to the destination coordinate system as they had to the original coordinate system.

Note:
If the number of elements and the specified increment angle add up to more than a 360 degree angle, the array elements will overlap.
XC Offset
(Rectangular Array)
Specifies the distance between reference points in columns.
YC Offset
(Rectangular Array)
Specifies the distance between reference points in rows
Array Angle
(Rectangular Array)
Specifies the angle of the array, measured counter- clockwise from the positive XC axis, at the array origin.
Number Along XC
(Rectangular Array)
Specifies how many duplicates of the selected entities to place in the positive XC direction.
Number Along YC
(Rectangular Array)
Specifies how many duplicates of the selected entities to place in the positive YC direction.
Result
Specifies how to carry out the desired transformation.
Move
Moves the selected tool paths or operations from their original location to a new location.
The tool path name remains the same, and the tool path retains its position in the CLSF file.
Copy
Creates a new operation, with its own set of parameters and tool paths, and retains the original location of the selected tool paths.
The new tool paths are appended to the CLSF file and are not associative to the original tool path. The new path or operation is assigned the current name appended with _COPY.
Number of Unassociative Copies lets you specify how many copies to create.
Instance
Creates linked instances of an operation that are directly related to the original operation.
The new path or operation is assigned the current name appended with _instance.
Number of Instances lets you specify how many linked instances to create.
Note:
Editing a linked instance of an operation modifies all the instances. To update all linked instances when you regenerate, the Update All Instances check box in the Manufacturing Preferences dialog box must be selected.
To edit an individual instance, the Unlink Instances check box in the Manufacturing Preferences dialog box must be selected.
There is only one set of data for instanced operations, and only the tool path is copied for each instance. This means that some functionality, such as the in-process workpiece, is not available for instances because the data is not copied for each instance.
Distance/Angle Divisions
Specifies how many equal parts you want the transformation angle or distance divided into.
If you select Move, the transformation is to the first subdivision of the total distance (or angle).
If you select Copy, or Instance, each copy or instance is spaced according to the subdivided distance or angle.
Remove Transformation
Appears only when there is an existing transformation to remove.
Removes a transformed tool path and moves the operation back to its original position. If several transformations were applied to the operation, all transformed tool paths are removed.
Note:
When you click Remove Transformation, NX immediately removes the transformed tool path and sets the operation status to Regenerate . If you click Cancel, the dialog box closes, but the transformed tool path is still removed. You must generate the operation and then reapply the desired transformation.

Allows you to make corrections or modifications to a generated tool path. See Tool Path Editor.
Trim
Opens the Trim Tool Path dialog box. This command lets you trim away unwanted portions of a generated tool path. This is useful as a temporary fix to keep the cutter out of unwanted areas.
Lock
Protects the tool path from being accidentally overwritten. Use this command if you do not want to overwrite the tool path accidentally when upgrading from a prior version of NX, after editing the tool path, or when using a function like flowcut manual cut order.
Divide
Opens the Tool Path Divide dialog box. Use this command to divide an existing into multiple operations that are each limited to a maximum cutting time or path travel length.
Tilt Tool Axis
Opens the Tilt Tool Axis dialog box. Use this command to avoid tool holder collisions in surface contouring, cavity milling, and Zlevel operations.
Divide by Holder
Opens the Divide by Holder dialog box. Use this command to split a single tool path into multiple tool paths using tools of different lengths to avoid collisions and machine the entire cut area.
Delete
This option allows you to delete the tool path for the currently highlighted operation.
List
List displays an Information window containing GOTO's, machine control information, feed rates, etc. The GOTO values are a ""snapshot"" of the current tool path. The values listed are referenced from the MCS stored in the operation.
Optimize Feed Rate
Opens the Optimize Feed Rate dialog box. This option monitors tool load and adusts the feedrate to maintain a uniform tool load.
Verify
This option allows you to inspect material removal with enhanced visualization of the part and cutter motion.
Simulate
If your part contains a kinematic model of a machine, you can use this option to simulate your entire machine tool in the cutting process.
For more information on simulating your machine tool, see NX Machine Tool Simulation Help.
Gouge Check
This option allows you to gouge check an operation highlighted in the Operation Navigator for which you have saved the tool path. In addition, you can optionally check for collisions with the tool holder. When gouges are found, the software displays them in a color of your choice. If you activate the Pause option, NX displays a motion range dialog indicating the gouge detections. The software stops at any subsequent gouge detection to indicate the range. If turned off, the system continues to process and display all gouges until the End-of-Path is reached. A report is written to the standard NX Information window listing the number of gouges detected.
Tip:
To see a report containing information about individual gouges, use the Gouge Check option.
The gouge check is faster when the tool axis is aligned, in either the positive or negative direction, along the main X, Y, or Z axis. Rotating the tool axis or the MCS increases the calculation time.
Note:
If you want the software to automatically gouge check an operation before postprocessing, you can activate the Gouge check before Postprocessing option in the Manufacturing → Output → Postprocessing section of the customer defaults.
The following table explains how certain parameters affect gouge checking. There is no user interface for these values, since they are taken from the operation being gouge checked.
Safe Clearance
When checking for holder collisions, the software takes this value from the operation. It defines the minimum distance the tool holder should stay away from the material.
Intol/Outtol
Changing the Intol or Outtol values of an operation alters the tolerance for gouging motions. NX uses the following formula to calculate a threshold value from the specified Intol/Outtol:
2*(Intol+(Intol+Outtol)/2)
NX compares the depth of each gouge against the threshold value, then reports all gouges that are greater than the threshold value.
Part Offset and/or Part Stock
The cutters diameter is virtually enlarged by the sum of this value. If the real tool comes closer to the part than this value, the internal virtual tool intersects the part and a gouge is reported.
Transforming
Transforming or editing the path does not change the stock or tolerance values. If you transform a correct tool path to go right through the part geometry, gouges are found.
The Gouge Check column of the Operation Navigator quickly shows you the gouge check status of each operation.
List Gouges
This command is available after you run the Gouge Check command on the selected operations. This command opens the Tool Path Report dialog box. In that dialog box, you can view a list of gouges for each selected tool path, and open the Information window for further review and output.
If you have not yet checked the operation for gouges, this option is unavailable.
Report Shortest Tool
This command calculates the shortest tool necessary for a collision-free tool path.
Load
This option adds the selected tool paths to run time memory when the tool path is listed, replayed, or generated. Once loaded, the tool path remains loaded for the remainder of the work session. This results in faster response time each time the tool path is subsequently listed, replayed, or generated.
Unload
This option removes the selected internal tool paths from run time memory, thereby freeing up space. This action is most useful when very long paths are generated or pulled in from a file. Only paths that have been saved or that are unchanged can be unloaded. Before performing the action, the paths are checked. If any of the paths cannot be unloaded, a warning message is displayed with the path names that cannot be unloaded. The action then proceeds with all the paths that can be unloaded."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/id1407812,Tilt Tool Axis,"Use the Tilt Tool Axis command to avoid tool holder collisions in surface contouring, cavity milling, and Zlevel operations. NX either trims the tool path and retracts the tool, or replaces the 3-axis, 4-axis, or 5-axis motions with 5-axis tilting motions.
You can:
Reach greater depths using the shortest tools possible for added rigidity.
Adjust the tool path for fixed-axis, 4-axis, and 5-axis operations.
Use tools without a defined shank or holder.
Use ball or non-ball tools.
Modify the tool tilt multiple times in direct succession.
In these examples, the tool axis tilts when a tool holder collision is detected, so that the tool can continue cutting down the wall towards the bottom of the part.
Note:
If you regenerate the operation in which NX tilts the tool path, the tool path reverts to the original tool path.
Support for tools other than ball mills
NX checks for gouges, collisions, and motion outside of the swinging axis limits of the machine tool. If NX finds one of these conditions, it trims the tool path and retracts the tool.
Support for ball-end tools
For ball-end tools, you can do the following:
Manually tilt the entire tool path to any 3+2 axis orientation by specifying spherical angles.
Manually tilt the entire tool path towards or away from a point or 3D curve before NX performs the collision check and creates avoidance moves.
Specify what NX should do when the initial tool position could cause a tool gouge, or a collision with the shank or holder. You can automatically do the following:
Tilt the tool to a safe orientation.
Retract the tool and trim the paths.
Limit motion to match the machine tool swinging axis limit.
Avoid pole transition by defining a minimum angle for the swing/tilt axis.
Turn collision checking off in the operation and generate an initial tool path that positions the tool in the entire machining area without considering tool neck, shank, or holder collisions. You can then use the Tilt Tool Axis command to create a collision-free tool path that considers the machine tool limits and swing/tilt characteristics.
For example, you can create a tool path that positions the ball portion of the tool in undercut areas, and then use the Tilt Tool Axis command to produce an optimized tool path without collisions.

Prerequisites
A fixed-axis or variable-axis surface contouring operation, or a Zlevel 3-axis operation.
To tilt the tool manually and/or to avoid collision by tilting:
The tool must have a ball shape where the lower radius of the tool = ½ of the diameter of the tool.
To position the tool manually, you should turn collision checking off in the operation. To position the tool in undercuts, you must turn collision checking off in the operation.
A defined shank and holder are recommended, but not mandatory.

Specifies parameters that control the tool axis tilt.
Manual Tilting list
Specifies how to apply the tool axis tilt.
Keep Original
Does not apply the Manual Tilting settings. NX maintains the original tool axis orientation unless there is a potential collision.
The tool begins cutting in the original tool axis orientation.
As NX encounters a potential collision, it tilts the tool minimally to avoid the collision and then returns the tool to the original tool axis orientation. NX repeats these tool motions when it encounters the next collision.
User Defined
Applies the Manual Tilting settings. Lets you specify a fixed tilt angle or define geometry to control the tilt direction.
Reference
Specifies the reference axis used to calculate the tilt angle. +ZM is the default axis.
Tool Tilt Method list
Specifies the manual tilt method used.

Toward Curve
Away from Curve
Let you use a curve to control whether the top of the tool holder tilts towards the guiding curve or away from the guiding curve. These settings define the orientation of the tilt plane around the +ZM axis.
Toward Curve
Away from Curve
NX calculates the rotation around the +ZM axis by projecting the shortest distance vector from the tool position to a reference point on the guiding curve.
Shortest Distance
Creates a reference point on the selected guiding curve to generate the tilt plane. The reference point is the shortest distance from the tool position on the tool path.
2D
Measures the shortest distance vector by projecting along the +ZM axis onto a plane. The reference point on the guiding curve has the same X and Y coordinates as the projected point. This option is best for planar curves.
3D
Measures the shortest distance vector in 3D space. This option is best for complex curves that do not have a single clear orientation.
Shortest Distance = 2D
Shortest Distance = 3D

1 Reference point, 2 Guiding curve, 3 Tool path, 4 Shortest distance, 5 Tilt plane
Tilt Angle
Sets the tilt angle inside the tilt plane. How NX measures the value depends on the Tilt Rule and Shortest Distance settings.
Note:
NX limits the applied tilt angle to a range that is within the values you enter for Min Angle and Max Angle in the Swinging/Tilting Axis Limits group.
Tilt Rule
Controls how NX measures the tilt angle inside the tilt plane. The tilt plane is defined by the +ZM axis and a line through the tool position that intersects the reference point on the selected guiding curve.
Toward Constant with Shortest Distance = 2D and 3D
Allows you to set a constant amount of tilt unless the tool axis must change either to avoid collisions or when moving to another cut area on the part.
Note:
When you use the toward constant tilt rule, the tool will not tilt until it is within the fan distance.
Toward Snap with Shortest Distance = 2D
Measures the tilt angle from the +ZM axis towards the line that intersects the reference point on the selected guiding curve. The tool axis snaps to the guiding curve when the tilt angle through the reference point on the curve is smaller than the specified Tilt Angle value. NX generates a 4+1 axis motion as long as the tool axis does not touch the guiding curve before the subsequent collision check.
Note:
The Tilt Angle value for this rule should be larger than zero, or NX will not tilt the tool axis prior to collision avoidance.
Tilt Angle = 30
1 Guiding curve
2 Line intersecting reference point on guiding curve
Note:
When you use the toward snap tilt rule, the tool will snap toward or away from the curve anywhere within the fan distance.
Away with Shortest Distance = 2D
Measures the tilt angle away from the line that intersects the reference point on the selected guiding curve towards the +ZM axis.
When Tilt Angle = 0, the tool axis intersects the reference point on the selected guiding curve.
Tilt Angle = 0
1 Guiding curve
2 Line intersecting reference point on guiding curve
When Tilt Angle is greater than 0, NX reduces the amount of tilt.
Tilt Angle = 30
1 Guiding curve
2 Line intersecting reference point on guiding curve
Through with Shortest Distance = 2D and 3D
The through tilt rule is the same as setting the tilt rule to Away, and the Tilt Angle to 0.0000. You cannot set a tilt angle when using this tilt rule.
Toward Point
Away from Point
Let you use a point to control whether the top of the tool holder tilts towards the point or away from the point. These settings define the orientation of the tilt plane around the +ZM axis.
Toward Point
Away from Point
Tilt Angle
Sets the tilt angle inside the tilt plane. How NX measures the value depends on the Tilt Rule setting.
Note:
NX limits the applied tilt angle to a range that is within the values you enter for Min Angle and Max Angle in the Swinging/Tilting Axis Limits group.
Tilt Rule
Controls how NX measures the tilt angle inside the tilt plane. The tilt plane is defined by the +ZM axis and a line through the tool position that intersects the selected guiding point.
Toward Constant
Allows you to set a constant amount of tilt unless the tool axis must change either to avoid a collision or to move to another cut area on the part.
Note:
When you use the toward constant tilt rule, the tool will not tilt until it is within the fan distance.
Toward Snap
Measures the tilt angle from the +ZM axis towards the line intersecting the guiding point. The tool axis snaps to the guiding point when the tilt angle through the point is smaller than the specified Tilt Angle value. NX generates a 4+1 axis motion as long as the tool axis does not touch the guiding point before the subsequent collision check.
Note:
The Tilt Angle value for this rule should be larger than zero, or NX will not tilt the tool axis prior to collision avoidance.

1 Guiding point
2 Line intersecting the guiding point
Note:
When you use the toward snap tilt rule, the tool will snap toward or away from the point anywhere within the fan distance.
Away
Measures the tilt angle away from the line intersecting the guiding point towards the +ZM axis. When Tilt Angle = 0, the tool axis intersects the guiding point. This tool axis behavior is similar to that in variable-axis contouring operations, except for the following:
Collision avoidance
Limiting tilt to the minimum and maximum angle limits of the swinging/tilting machine axis

1 Guiding point
2 Line intersecting guiding point
Through
The through tilt rule is the same as setting the tilt rule to Away, and the Tilt Angle to 0.0000. You cannot set a tilt angle when using this tilt rule.
Fixed
Defines a fixed orientation using spherical angles, such as those used on a B-C dual axis fork head.
Tilt Angle defines the amount of tilting from the +ZM axis.
Angle from +XM defines the rotation of the tilt plane about the +ZM axis, and is measured from the +XM axis.
NX first rotates the tool axis around the +YM axis by the Tilt Angle value, then rotates the tool axis around the +ZM axis by the Angle from +XM value. NX rotates positive angles in the counterclockwise direction.
1 Positive Tilt Angle value
2 Positive Angle from +XM value

1 Tool Holder
2 Tool Shank
3 Tool Neck
Note:
The default clearance values are taken from the original operation. When you set the clearance values, always set the minimum clearance distance required. Large clearance values may result in partial or unsmooth tool paths.
Tilt Clearance Angle
Specifies the angle used to clear the tool. NX adds the clearance angle to the Tool Holder, Tool Shank, and Tool Neck clearances.
Tilt Clearance Angle = 0
Tilt Clearance Angle > 0
The Tilt Clearance Angle value gives controllers with internal smoothing routines the ability to smooth the tool path. A higher value increases the freedom the controller has to smooth the tool path, but it decreases the amount of tilt available for NX to avoid collisions.
Note:
The time required for NX to find a collision-free tilting solution increases as the Tilt Clearance Angle value increases, and a large value can make it impossible for NX to find a collision free solution for the tool path. The Tilt Clearance Angle value should be as small as possible, but large enough to give the controller some freedom for the smoothing routine. When necessary, NX retracts the tool to avoid violating this value."

A larger step size improves performance. However, when the step size is too large, NX may not have enough data points to avoid collisions.

For each operation, the machine coordinate system used depends on the following criteria:
If there is a valid kinematics model, NX uses the coordinate system of the Machine Zero junction.
If there is no kinematics model, and an MCS geometry group is defined, NX uses the coordinate system of the parent MCS. If more than one MCS geometry group is defined, NX uses the coordinate system of the highest level parent MCS. For this example, operations 1 and 2 use the coordinate system defined for MCS_MILL1. Operations 3 and 4 use the coordinate system defined for MCS_MILL2.

Rotary and swinging axis limit control
After defining the rotary axis, you can use the options for rotary axis and swinging axis limits to:
Prevent tool paths that cannot be milled by your machine. To do this, use the Max Angle option. Usually this option controls your machine tool A or B limit.
For example, if your machine limits are between +30 and –115 degrees, set Max Angle to 115. Your post handles the minus sign.
For special machine configurations, such as a rotary table with a 45 degree incline, consult with Customer Support.
Guide NX to by-pass singularities. To do this, use the Min Angle option.
When the tool is almost aligned with the rotary axis, a small angular change in tool orientation may require a nearly 180 degree motion of the table. This condition is called a singularity.
(1) Motion is allowed within the Min Angle and Max Angle limits.
(2) Motion is not allowed beyond the Max Angle limit.
(3) Motion near the pole area is high-risk. The machine can do this motion, but the machining results are not optimal. This limit is set by the Min Angle option.

When you use the shortest tool possible, your cutting tool setup is generally more rigid, which can extend tool life.
When NX calculates the shortest tool length:
NX uses part geometry, blank geometry, and check geometry.
NX supports the shank as well as the holder.
NX considers the holder and shank clearance.
If both the holder and shank are defined for a tool, NX reports the shortest tool that satisfies both the holder and shank clearance values.
Changing the Tool Insertion offset value does not affect the shortest tool value.
The operation parameters and tool path do not change. You determine which tool to use based on the reported value.
The recommended value displays in the Report Shortest Tool group in the operation's dialog box, and in the Shortest Tool Length column in the Operation Navigator. The recommended value is an approximation. In all cases, NX rounds up the reported value to 1 decimal point for metric parts and 2 decimal points for inch parts. For example:
120.206 mm = 120.3 mm
30.206 in = 30.21 in

https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/mcs_overview,Machine Coordinate System (MCS),"The Machine Coordinate System (MCS) determines the orientation and origin of tool paths for all operations in the orient group. The Work Coordinate System (WCS) determines most input parameters, such as From points, clearance planes, and the tool axis.
The MCS has an initial position that is matched to the Absolute Coordinate System. The position of the MCS is saved in the part file. Each orient group (for example, MCS, MCS_MILL) defines the MCS that is necessary to machine a specific side of the part. If you move the MCS, you re-establish the base location for the subsequent tool path output points. The MCS has the following characteristics:
It stores the Reference Coordinate System (RCS).
It can store the Clearance plane, Lower Limit plane, and Avoidance points.
Operations stored under the MCS parent inherit the parameters specified in the MCS parent.
Operations moved from one MCS to another do not need to be generated to reflect the new orientation or origin.
Common uses for the MCS
The MCS is useful when you do the following:
Output the tool path in relation to the machine home position or any other frequently used setup location.
Reorient the machine tool axes to the workpiece.
Shift large parts for successive tool paths.
Set up parts which no longer have a reference point; for example, a tooling hole which has been machined away.
Reestablish setup position and orientation after rotary table movement and after compound axis movement.
Maintain critical dimensions that would be otherwise lost to warping or tolerance buildup.
Establish basic and true positions.

If the MCS moves, the zero point of all the tool paths that use it move with it.
It is helpful to create and save a clearance plane when you specify the orientation and origin of the machine coordinate system in an MCS parent group. The clearance plane defines a safe clearance distance for tool motion before and after an operation.
This example shows how to create an MCS geometry parent group with a specified clearance plane.

Details
Purpose
Specifies the coordinate system as Main or Local. By default, all coordinate systems are local. In some types of programming, such as fixture offsets, you need to define a main coordinate system at the center of rotation of the machine tool. Then you create local coordinate systems under the main coordinate system in the Geometry View to represent the offset location for each fixture.
Special Output
Available when Purpose is set to Local.
Special Output only affects the postprocessor output.
None
(Default) Bases the output on the local MCS coordinates.
Use Main MCS
Ignores the local MCS coordinates and bases the output on the main MCS. The main MCS is found in the geometry tree above the local MCS in the Geometry View.
Fixture Offset
Bases the output on the local MCS coordinates. The postprocessor can use these coordinates along with the main coordinates to output fixture offsets, such as G54.
CSYS Rotation
Bases the output on the local MCS coordinates. The postprocessor can use these coordinates along with the main coordinates to output programming in a local coordinate system, such as CYCLE 19.
CSYS Rotation only supports coordinate system functions such as G68.1, cycle 19, and G125 for orthogonal head and table positioning on common mill/turn B/C machine tools. For all other machine tools, use the Fixture Offset output.
Use Inherited MCS
Ignores the local MCS coordinates and bases the output on the parent MCS. The parent MCS is found in the geometry tree immediately above the local MCS in the Geometry View.
Fixture Offset
Specifies the fixture offset number for machines that use a fixture offset. Each part orientation on the machine corresponds to a specific MCS, and thus a specific fixture offset value. The software loads the fixture offset value into MOM_post during output to create the appropriate G code.
Save MCS
Creates a coordinate system entity based on the current MCS. This is useful if you need to select this as your WCS.
Reference Coordinate System
Link RCS to MCS
Lets you specify a different location for the RCS.
Link RCS to MCS
Places the RCS at the same location and orientation as the MCS.
Specify RCS

The software uses the RCS to relocate tool axis vectors, clearance planes, and avoidance points when you move an operation from one section of a part to another.
Clearance
The clearance plane defines a safe clearance distance for tool motion before and after an operation and during any programmed obstacle avoidance.
These options are inherited by the Non Cutting moves of operations in this Mill Orient group.

Point
Specifies the safe point to transfer to. You can either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.
Bounding Cylinder
Specifies a cylinder shape as clearance geometry. The cylinder size is determined by the shape of the part and a specified Safe Clearance distance. The software always assumes that the volume outside the cylinder is safe clearance.
Select Bounding Cylinder and enter a clearance value to determine the cylinder size.
Cylinder
Specifies a cylinder shape as clearance geometry. This cylinder is of infinite length. The software always assumes that the volume outside the cylinder is safe clearance.
To create the cylinder, you must:
Enter a Radius value and specify a center point.
To specify the point, either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.
Specify a tool axis direction.
To specify the tool axis, either selecting geometry or use the Vector Constructor to specify the tool axis.
Sphere
Specifies a sphere shape as clearance geometry. The sphere size is determined a radius value. The software always assumes that the volume outside the sphere is safe clearance.
To create the sphere, you must:
Enter a Radius value and specify a center point.
To specify the point, either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.
Bounding Box
Specifies a box shape as clearance geometry. The box size is determined by the shape of the part and a specified Clearance distance. The software always assumes that the volume outside the box is safe clearance.
Select Bounding Box and enter a clearance value to determine the box size.
Note:
If there is no previous clearance plane definition, the inherited option is the same as None.
Lower Limit Plane
These options are inherited by the Non Cutting moves of operations in this Mill Orient group.
Lower Limit Option
Lets you specify the lower limit plane. The lower limit plane defines the lower limit of cutting and non cutting tool motions in some operations.
Avoidance
These options are inherited by the Non Cutting moves of operations in this Mill Orient group.
For descriptions of Avoidance options, see Avoidance tab options.
Tool Axis
Tool Axis
Lets you specify a tool axis for this geometry group.
The tool axis specified here is inherited by fixed axis operations when you select Specify Vector from the Axis list in the main operation dialog box.
Note:
The All Axes option is used only to determine feature based machining accessibility vectors.
Use Axis Limits
Available when Tool Axis is set to All Axes
Specifies limits for the machining access direction vector.
None
NX accepts all features when creating feature groups, and all tool axis directions when creating operations.
Rotate: Y, Tilt: Z, Rotate: X, Tilt: Z, Rotate: Z, Tilt: X
Lets you specify a range of acceptable rotation and tilt angles for the Group Features and Create Feature Process commands. Valid inputs for rotation are between -180 and 180. Valid inputs for tilt are between -90 and 90.
The commands add a machining feature to a feature group only when the feature's access direction is within the specified ranges for rotation and tilt angle.
Example:
Use Axis Limits = Rotate: Z, Tilt: X
Minimal Tilt Angle = 0
Maximal Tilt Angle = 20
Minimal Rotation Angle = 0
Maximal Rotation Angle = 180
The Group Features and Create Feature Process commands add a machining feature to the feature group only if its access direction is between the rotation angles of 0° and +180° about the Z-axis, and also between the tilt angles of 0° and +20° about the X-axis.

Under List, note that the number of faces in the set is listed under Number of Items, and that the word No appears under Custom Data.
When there is no custom data, the faces in the set are machined according to the operation defaults.
Pause your cursor over one of the highlighted faces.
The selection rule that was used for the face is included in the face information that appears beside the cursor.
Hold down the Shift key, and with the cursor still over a highlighted face, wait until the three dots for the QuickPick tool appear, and then click.
You have the option to deselect all faces of the intent, or just a single face.
Close the QuickPick dialog box to cancel the deselection.
Click Add New Set .
Select any single face of the part.
In this example, all part faces are blended and thus all faces are tangent. You can apply other rules, such as a color or an attribute, or make multiple selections for the same set.

Trim Boundaries apply to the Area Milling and Flow Cut drive methods of Fixed Axis Surface Contouring. Trim Boundaries further constrain the cut regions. You may define the area of the cut region to be excluded from the operation by specifying Material as Inside or Outside. Trim boundaries are always Closed, always use an On condition, and are projected to the Part geometry along the tool axis vector. More than one Trim Boundary may be defined. You may specify a Trim Stock to define the distance the tool is positioned from the Trim Boundary, and Boundary Intol/Outol.
Part Offset
Part Offset adds to or subtracts from the modeled part geometry by a specified offset (thickness) value. A positive value offsets the thickness outside the part. A negative value offsets the thickness inside the part. The cutter recognizes the Part Offset as the workpiece and machines to it accordingly. Part Stock and Custom Stock are measured from the Part Offset. This is useful when the model geometry is offset from the part you are machining, such as an EDM electrode or a sheet metal die."

See Common dialog box options for common options not discussed here.
Some models contain geometry errors that can create multiple shells and an incorrect tool path. Use the Topology options to inspect the model for missing, duplicated, and non-tangent faces. NX uses the settings to connects each object in a shell to every adjacent object.
Tolerances
Lets you adjust the distance and angle tolerances so that all the geometry is connected into one or more shells. You can then generate an acceptable tool path.
Distance
Specifies the maximum value that two objects can be apart and still considered connected. If surfaces are adjacent, one or more shells are created when you rebuild the topology.
Enter a larger value to join two objects that are not connected with the default value.
Angle
Specifies the maximum angle, in degrees, that the normals of two adjacent faces (or curves) can vary at an edge.
For example, if you enter a value of 5 degrees and the angle along an edge between two faces is less than 5 degrees, NX classifies the edge tangent.
Rebuild Topology
Creates the shell if the surfaces are adjacent. NX considers surfaces adjacent if the gaps are less than the specified tolerance.
NX does not modify the model geometry.

Part, blank, and check boundaries are mainly used for Planar Milling. Trim boundaries are used in Planar Milling and are also used for containment in the solids based processors such as Cavity Milling and Surface Contouring.
They define a path or area.
A single boundary, for example, a pocket or closed area, contains the tool. Combined boundaries, for example, a pocket with an island, can both contain and exclude the tool.
They have a material side or tool side.
They consist of members.
Each member is a segment which may contain custom data, such as Intol/Outtol, Stock, and Tool Position. A segment can be the edge of a face or a curve.
Individual members are easily identified by their tool position indicators.
They are always planar.
In Milling and Wire EDM operations, boundaries define a volume, path or direction.
NX projects the selected geometry to the boundary plane. The projection is along a vector that is normal to the boundary plane.
In Turning operations, boundaries define a planar cross section of material to be removed.
They are displayed as temporary entities and disappear whenever the screen is refreshed.
They have a start point, forward direction, and end point.
When you create a boundary from a face, NX automatically establishes the boundary direction.
When you create a boundary from curves, edges, or points, you establish the boundary direction. The direction is from the first item you select to the second item you select.
After the boundary direction is established, you cannot edit it or reverse it.

The boundary user interface introduced in NX 9 is used to specify all boundaries except the drive geometry for the Boundary drive method. The Boundary drive method is available in fixed axis and variable axis surface contouring operations, such as surface contour, guiding curves, and streamline.
NX automatically updates legacy operations to the correct Tool Side value. The Tool Side option replaces the Material Side option that was available in versions prior to NX 9.0.
Boundaries interface
The way to define Milling boundaries is consistent with the way you define other types of geometry and includes the following.
The graphics display clearly shows the boundary plane and the projection vector.
1 Boundary label
2 Boundary plane
3 Boundary projection vector
You can see each boundary segment projected to the boundary plane as you select it.
You can identify the start point, end point, boundary direction, and tool side for each boundary.
Boundary selected:
1 Start point
2 Tool side indicator (left)
3 Direction arrow
4 Tool position indicator (Tanto)
5 End point
The graphics display includes custom offsets for the boundary and for individual members.
Boundary member selected:
1 Boundary label
2 Custom boundary Offset input box connected to the start point
3 Custom boundary Member Offset input box connected to the position indicator of the member
4 Selected boundary member
The Tool Side option replaces the Material Side option. NX automatically updates legacy operations to the correct Tool Side value.
Pre-NX 9 boundaries interface
Using the pre-NX 9 boundaries interface, you can see each boundary segment projected to the boundary plane as you select it. NX automatically closes gaps in the boundary as you select the boundary segments.
In pre-NX 9 boundaries:
You use the Material Side option to specify which side of the boundary you do not want to cut.
The graphics display when you create or edit the boundary includes the start point and tool position indicators. The material side, end point, and boundary plane are not shown.

Mold and Die Sequences
There are special geometry groups for machining processes, that contain a specific sequence of operations. For example, the die_sequence type contains geometry groups that create complete processes for Zlevel cutting, zigzag cutting, and 3D profiling.
The process assistants are provided for these. To read more about it go to Mold and Die Setups.
Parent Group/Subtype
Description
SEQUENCE_ZIGZAG
Use this option to cut mold cores and cavities that are mostly shallow, without steep walls or deep areas. After the initial roughing, it uses a series of operations that finish the areas with zig-zag cutting in a criss-cross fashion, and flowcut to cut the valleys. The operations use progressively smaller tools, stock, and tolerance. Common tools and methods are included in the setup, so you can modify the predefined operations, or create more of your own.
SEQUENCE ZLEVEL
Use this option to cut mold cores and cavities containing steep walls or deep areas. After the initial roughing, it uses a series of operations that finish the areas with zig-zag cutting in the non-steep areas, zlevel cutting in the steep areas, and flowcut to cut the valleys. The operations use progressively smaller tools, stock, and tolerance. Common tools and methods are included in the setup, so you can modify the predefined operations, or create more of your own.
SEQUENCE IPW
Use this option to rough a mold core or cavity with rest milling. It uses a series of cavity milling operations with progressively smaller tools. Using the in process workpiece (IPW), each operation cuts only the material remaining from the previous operations. This is commonly used to reduce the steps left by roughing, and to clean out material in corners left by a larger tool.
SEQUENCE_PROFILE_2D
Use this option to cut a 2d profile with a series of five operations, using progressively smaller tools and less stock. A common boundary is machined, and the depth is controlled with the floor plane. The operations use the 2D in process workpiece (IPW) to clean out the material in the corners that are left by the previous tool. This is commonly used for the edges of trim dies.
SEQUENCE_PROFILE_3D
Use this option to cut a 3d profile with a series of five operations, using progressively smaller tools and less stock. A common boundary is machined, and the depth is controlled by offsetting from the height of the edges or curves used to create the boundary. The operations use the 2D in process workpiece (IPW) to clean out the material in the corners that are left by the previous tool. This is commonly used for the edges of trim dies.
SEQUENCE_TOOL
This demonstrates the use of holder collision checking and minimum material removal in a series of cavity milling operations. The sequence starts with a short tool, and each following operation uses a longer tool. If any of the operations will remove less than 35% of the remaining material, they are suppressed.
SEQUENCE_ZIGZAG_HSM
This is similar to SEQUENCE_ZIGZAG, but the depths of cut, stepovers, stock, tolerance, corner smoothing, and engages have been modified for high speed machining of mold steel.
SEQUENCE_ZLEVEL_HSM
This is similar to SEQUENCE_ZlEVEL, but the depths of cut, stepovers, stock, tolerance, corner smoothing, and engages have been modified for high speed machining of mold steel."

Define a carrier and pockets to:
Manage the capacity, or number of tools that the device holds. NX will allow users to add tools only until the specified capacity Is reached.
Substitute tools between pockets without redefining tool numbers by assigning tool numbers to the pockets.
Preload company default tools in templates.
Note:
When you create a carrier for turning tools, specify the lathe work plane relative to the WCS.
Pockets
For each pocket you can:
Specify an adjust register and cutcom register that is different than the tool number. Both registers match the tool number by default.
Tools inherit the pocket number and register values.
Turning tools do not use register values inherited from the pocket. Turning tools support multiple tracking points, and each tracking point can have different register values.
Modify the list of holding systems on the pocket.
Use the holding systems when you want to restrict tool loading. For example, you may have some positions on a turret that accept one holding system, and other positions that accept a different holding system.
Specify the capacity. The default value is 1.
Pockets inherit adjust register and cutcom register from the machine model.

You can specify an angled head by selecting the head axis with a vector. This vector will be used to output rotary and linear coordinates for your machine tool. The head object will not change the tool axis or the goto points in the operation.
Note:
The Head object replaces the previous HOLDER functionality.
For the Postprocessor, the head's kinematics are passed as mom variables to the Machine Tool Drivers (MTD) used for NX Machine Tool Simulation (NX MTS). The MTD then makes a new junction to correctly orient the tool. In the Machine Tool view of the Operation Navigator, place an operation under the appropriate head object to process the goto points in the generated tool paths with the correct kinematics information. Head doesn't send output to the CLSF. The tool path contains the correct rotated coordinates. A head used in this manner has the same affect on the tool path as a HOLDER command on the LOAD UDE had in previous versions.
The usage of the new head depends on the new kinematics. The mom_kin_iks_usage flag must be set to 1, for the software to use the head object in the tool view. In NX 4 and later; only the head object and the new mom variables will be used, the HOLDER word will be ignored.
There is no vocabulary output to the CLSF for the head object. The tool path itself will contain the correct rotated coordinates."

The parameters describing the insert shape depend on the selected insert type.
Tool tab
Insert
Insert Shape
Specifies an insert shape as used by the majority of tool vendors.
Standard
The standard grooving insert represents a cutter with two identical corner radii.
Full Nose Radius
This insert type describes a grooving tool having no bottom edge with the insert width being equivalent to the tool's nose diameter.
Ring Type Joint
The ring type joint grooving tool represents a special tool type with no corner radii and side edges not providing clearance for plunge cuts.
User Defined
This insert shape allows for maximum variability of the grooving insert, as it represents a cutter with two independent corner radii and two independent side clearance angles.
Insert Position
This determines the spindle direction for machining.
Topside
This will cause the spindle to turn clockwise when cutting above centerline.
Underside
This will cause the spindle to turn counterclockwise when cutting above centerline.
Legend
Displays a sketch representing the currently selected tool insert shape.
Dimensions
(OA) Orient Angle
Measured CCLW from the positive X-axis to the first cutting edge met from exterior.
Warning:
The operation's level angle (or the level angle +/- 180) should not equal the tool's orient angle. If these are equal, the system cannot determine which side to move into the material in linear roughing. You can try making your tool orient angle incrementally larger or smaller (eg. 359.9999) or try using a plunge zig cutting strategy with an appropriate step angle and cleanup inactive.
(IL) Insert Length
This parameter represents the total length of the insert.
(IW) Insert Width
The insert width describes the width of a groove that would result from a straight cut (radial cut for OD groove tool) into material. This parameter appears with the Standard, Ring Type Joint and User Defined Tools.
(R) Radius
This is the radius of the circle at the corner of the cutter. The Standard tool Radius assumes the tool's left and right nose radii are equal. You may define a left and right Radius in User Defined tool types.
(SA) Side Angle
The side angle defines the clearance angles of the tool on the left and on the right side as equal. An insert shape as shown in the Standard sketch represents a positive value of the side angle. This parameter appears only in the Standard and Full Nose Radius tool types.
(LA) Left Angle , (RA) Right Angle
These angles define the clearance angles of the tool with the possibility to insert unequal values if the tool that you are defining is asymmetrical
The left angle is the angle on the left side of the tool at an orientation angle of 90 degrees as seen from the top.
(TA) Tip Angle
This parameter represents the angle at the bottom of the cutter to the rotation axis. The TA shown in the sketch represents a positive value of the tip angle. This parameter appears only in the dialogs for Standard and User Defined tools.

Limits
Maximum Tool Reach
This is the maximum distance which a tool and its holder can travel into a part. This is dependant upon the geometry of a part and the tool holder. The purpose of this parameter is to prevent collision of the tool holder with the part.
Maximum Depth
This parameter describes the maximum depth per cut that the tool can plunge into a groove. This is dependant upon the geometry of the insert. Notice the relationship between Max Depth and Level Depth in the grooving operation.
Minimum Facing Diameter
This is the minimum diameter that the tool can cut when grooving on the face of the part (trepanning) that will not cause interference on the outside of the tool.
This option must be customized into the dialog box.
Maximum Facing Diameter
This is the maximum diameter that the tool can cut when grooving on the face of the part (trepanning) that will not cause interference on the inside of the tool.

These tools are intended for use with the Point to Point module. The Point to Point module only recognizes a drilling tool. Therefore, the spotdrill, boring bar, reamer, counterbore, countersink, and tap are all seen by the system as the standard drill. These subtypes are available to help you separate and organize your tools.
For example, when you select Tap as your subtype and select OK, the system displays the drilling tool dialog. Enter the parameters for a tap and select OK. The system displays this tap in the Machine Tool View of the Operation Navigator as a Tap. To you it is a tap, to the system it is a drilling tool.
You can also use Holemaking tools for point to point operations. However, the processor does not recognize all the Holemaking tool parameters.
Drilling Tool Dialog Parameters
Choose or define the following when creating a drill:
(D) Diameter
Diameter is the diameter of the drill.
(CR) Corner Radius
Corner Radius is the lower corner radius at the corner of the profile of the drill.
(L) Length
Length is the length of the drill.
(PA) Point Angle
Point Angle is the angle of the point of the drill.
(PL) Point Length
The length from the tool shoulder to the tool tip.
(FL) Flute Length
Flute Length is the height of the cutting area along the profile of the cutter. See previous diagram.
Number Flutes
Number Flutes is the number of flutes in the drill.
Direction
Direction is the spindle direction of the tool. Choose either CLW or CCLW.
XOFF
XOFF is a value used by the controller to position the tool with respect to a reference point. XOFF represents the distance from turret reference point to tool tip, parallel to the centerline.
Y/ZOFF
YOFF or ZOFF is a value used by the controller to position the tool with respect to a reference point. ZOFF and YOFF are measured along the turning axis of either the spindle or the lathe. ZOFF is used for drilling machines and YOFF is used for lathes which have no Z axis.
ADJUST Register
ADJUST Register allows you to correct the positioning of the tool due to variations in the milling machine. This option is similar for all tool types.
CUTCOM Register
CUTCOM Register allows you to correct the positioning of the tool due to the variations in tool diameter caused by wear. This option is similar for all tool types.
Tool/Face Number
Tool/Face Number provides a way to reference the tool or the turret location for the LOAD/TOOl command in the CLSF. This option is similar to the Tool Number option for milling tools and the Turret Face Number option for lathe tools.
Catalog Number
Catalog Number provides a method to track the tool. This option is similar for all tool types.
Display Tool
Display Tool allows you to display a profile of the tool in the graphics window. This option is similar for all tool types.
Coolant Through
Generates the mom variable mom_tool_coolant_through with a value of yes or no. The postprocessor uses this value to determine whether the tool has a coolant passage through the tool body, and outputs the corresponding coolant code.
This option does not create a Coolant On or Coolant Off user defined event. (UDE)."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/generic_solid_tool_ov,Solid tools,"Define solid tools for cases which do not match the existing milling, drilling, or turning parametric tool classes. For example, you can define probes, laser heads, and painting heads as solid tools.
All solid tools are library tools. You create the tool directly from the NX solid model with the following settings:
Type = probing
Tool Subtype = GENERIC or PROBE
Probe tools include additional parameters to define sensors and stems.
Solid modeled tools can be one solid model or an assembly, and support:
All display, verify, and simulation commands
Mounting junction and multiple tracking points
Special parameters for each tracking point
Sensor tip diameter, length and vector (direction)
Sensor tip shape
Storage in the ASCII library and in Teamcenter.
The tool parameters, such as stored tracking points, are available when needed. It is not necessary to parametrically define the shape of the tool because the solid model defines the shape, and tracking points determine what point on the solid follows the programmed path.
Note:
For an existing milling, drilling, or turning tool class, you completely define the tool parameters and export a solid model part file with the tool definition to use for simulation and verification.

The tool number (or T code) can come from three places: the pocket, the tool, and the operation. The tool number is inherited from the pocket level to the tool level to the operation level. Based on what the T code means on your NC machine, you need to decide which is the best way for you to assign tool numbers in your programs."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/parent_groups_parent_tool_asign_num,Assigning Tool Numbers,"There are three common scenarios for assigning tool numbers. These are described below.
Note:
If no tool number was assigned to the tool, you can assign the tool number in the setup and the link to the tool library will not be broken.
If no tool number was assigned to the tool, the tool number is automatically inherited pocket that you inserted the tool and the library link is not broken.
If the tool has a number greater than zero specified, and exported to the library. The tool number cannot be changed manually without breaking the library link to the tool.
Assign Tool Number at the Pocket Level
The most common scenario is to assign the T code to the tool position number on the machine. When the program asks for T1, the tool in pocket 1 is loaded. If this is how your machines work, create pockets in the Tool View, and assign them numbers to match your machine. This can be part of your setup template or library machine, so you do not need to do this for every program. Whenever you put a tool in a pocket, it inherits the tool number from the pocket. When you assign an operation to a tool, it inherits the tool number from the tool.
Assigning The Tool Number To The Pocket
Assign Tool Number at the Tool Level
The second most common scenario is to assign numbers to tools as tool codes, regardless of what pocket they are placed in on the machine. For example, a tool has a code of 1234, possibly programmed on a baluf chip or some other device. In this case, you should not use the pockets in the Tool View. You should assign the correct tool number to each tool, either in the tool dialog or in the tool library. Any operation assigned to the tool inherits the number from the tool.
Assigning The Tool Number in The Tool Dialog
If the tools in your library always have the same preassigned number, you can modify the tool library to assign the tool number, adjust register, and cutcom register for each tool.
Assign Tool Number at the Operation Level
In the third most common scenario, you may have a tool defined in the system that represents several identical tools on the machine. You might also have a tool defined in the system that has one tool number in one program in the setup, and a different number in another program in the same setup. In these cases, because the tool needs several different tool numbers to be output, enter a tool number in each operation that is assigned to the tool.
Assigning the Tool Number to the Operation
Library tool number
When a tool is created and saved to the library, or when a tool is retrieved from the library, and the tool is placed in a pocket in the manufacturing setup.
If the tool number is greater than zero, the number cannot be changed manually without breaking the library link to that tool."

This feed rate also applies to the return feed rate when the tool returns to the workpiece after lifts. An Engage feed rate of zero causes the tool to engage at the Cut feed rate.
Cut
Cut is the feed rate given for the tool movement while the cutter is in contact with part geometry.
Retract
Retract is the feed rate given for the tool movement to the Retract position from the final tool path cutting position. A Retract feed rate of zero causes the tool to retract at the Rapid feed rate for linear moves and at the Cut feed rate for circular moves.
First Cut
First Cut is the feed rate given for the initial cutting pass. (Subsequent passes feed at the Cut feed rate value.)
Note:
For Automatic Lathe Groove, the First Cut is also the feed rate for every Plunge cut into full material."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/parent_group_approach,Approach,"Approach is the Feed Rate given for the tool movement from the Start Point to the Engage position. In Planar and Cavity Milling operations that use multiple levels, the Approach feed rate is used to control the feed from one level to another.
In Surface Contouring, Approach is the feed rate given to the move prior to the engage move. This move may come from either a Start move or a Traversal move.
In Drill and Lathe Groove modules, an Approach feed rate of zero causes the tool to move at the Cut feed rate if specified minimum clearance is zero; otherwise, the Rapid feed rate is used.
In the other modules, an Approach feed rate of zero causes the tool to move at the Rapid feed rate if the engage method is specified; otherwise, the Engage feed rate is used.
Departure
Departure represents the feed rate for the moves out of the hole (or groove) used to clear out the chips in Lathe Groove and Lathe Drill.
In Surface Contouring, Departure is the feed rate given to the move after a retract move. This move may go to a Traversal move or may be a return move.
Thread
Thread is currently unavailable for all processors and is permanently greyed out.
Stepover
Stepover is the feed rate for the cutter as it moves to the next parallel pass. This does not apply if the tool lifts from the work surface. Therefore, the Stepover feed rate applies only to modules allowing Zig-Zag tool paths."

Side Cut
The Side Cut option applies only to the Lathe Groove module. It controls the sideways cutting movements for By Level Zig-Zag, Left to Right, and Right to Left cut methods. It does not control the plunging and contouring movements. The Side Cut feed rate does not apply to Plunge cut methods.
Traversal
Traversal (Planar Milling and Cavity Milling) is the feed rate used for fast horizontal non-cutting tool motion when the Transfer Method option on the Engage/Retract dialog box has a status of Previous Plane (instead of Clearance Plane).
Traversal feed rate is used only when the tool is the Vertical Clearance distance above the uncut surface and the Horizontal Clearance distance away from any cavity islands or walls. This protects part surfaces during tool transit and the tool may move without lifting to the Clearance Plane."

Program groups enable you to group and order operations for output. For example, suppose you have a part where you have a setup to machine the top side and a different set up to machine the bottom side. You can create a separate Program group for each setup.
A program:
Is equivalent to a tape file.
Usually contains multiple operations and generates all tool paths for these operations.
Specifies the order in which to run the operations.
You must have a program group to output a CLSF or to postprocess multiple operations. Create a group for each program to output. NX then outputs the operations to CLSF files and postprocessing files in the specified order.
The Program Order View is the only view of the Operation Navigator in which the order of the listed operations is relevant or important. All operations in a program appear below the program group, and are listed in the order in which they are executed on the machine tool.
Requires post processing to create the actual commands that are sent to the CNC controller.
It is suggested practice to create multiple program parent groups, and name them according to the programs that are output. For example, you can create one program group for roughing, and another program group for finishing. When you are ready to generate your output, selecting the program parent selects all of the operations assigned to that parent group.
The following graphic is an example of the Program Order View. In the furthest left hand column, under Title, you can see all the program parents. The parents are expanded so you can also see the operations within the programs. In this hierarchy, PROGRAM_GROUP is the parent of ROUGHING and GREEN_TOP_AREA

When generating operations, make note that the Unused Items parent is meant as a clipboard only. If you want to generate an operation, move it under one of the other program parents.

Non Cutting Moves
Smoothing
Override With Smooth Connections
Lets you replace most aspects of non-cutting moves creation with a semiautomatic method that is intended to generate safe, smooth, and efficient motions. Your input values influence the output motions; however, the automation may adjust the final shape.
Smooth Length
Available when you select the Override with Smooth Connections check box.
Determines the target length that is used when there is enough room, or the end point is safe with respect to part clearance, or the end points of cutting motions are open.
Smooth Height
Available when you select the Override with Smooth Connections check box.
Determines the target lift of the transition.
The lift is done along the tool axis, but is also affected by the part normal. This option uses the same considerations as the Smooth Length option. If the calculated length is shorter, then the height is proportionally shorter.
Max Stepover
Available when you select the Override with Smooth Connections check box.
Determines the stepover distance at which the smooth motion changes from a single segment at the stepover feed rate to three segments at the retract, traversal, and engage feed rates.
Tolerance
Available when you select the Override with Smooth Connections check box.
Sets the allowed deviation of the output linear moves from a calculated smooth spline. As the tolerance decreases, the number of output steps in the tool path increases and the motion becomes smoother.
To determine the tolerance, choose one of the following options.
Minimize Points—Approximates the calculated spline with a minimal number of straight steps. This method is recommended for old controllers.
From Cutting—Uses the specified Intol and Outtol values for cutting moves to control the number of straight steps required for the stepover. Output is typically a lot of lines of code with very smooth motion. This method is recommended for multi-axis operations.
Specify—Lets you specify a smoothing tolerance that generates the number of straight steps that you find acceptable.
Engage
Available only when you clear the Override with Smooth Connections check box in the Smoothing node.
Open Area
Open areas are regions where the tool can reach the current cut level, before removing material.
Initial
Controls the initial move of the operation to the first open area cut region or level.
Retract
Available only when you clear the Override with Smooth Connections check box in the Smoothing node.
Open Area
Open areas are regions where the tool can reach the current cut level, before removing material.
Final
Specifies the parameters for the last retract moves that follow the cutting moves.
Avoidance
From Point
Specifies the initial tool position at the start of a new tool path. NX outputs a FROM command as the first entry in the tool path.
Point Option
None—Does not use a specified From point.
Specify—Sets the From Point location. You can either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.
Tool Axis
None—Sets the From Point tool axis to 0,0,1.
Specify—Sets the Tool axis orientation. You can either select geometry or use the Vector Constructor to orient the tool axis.
Start Point
Point Option
None—Does not use a specified Start point location.
Specify—Sets the Start point location. You can either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.
Return Point
Point Option
None—Does not use a specified Return point location.
Specify—Sets the Return point location. You can either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.
Go Home Point
Specifies the final tool position. NX outputs a GOHOME command as the final entry in the tool path. The postprocessor always interprets the GOHOME command as a Rapid move.
Point Option
None—Does not use a specified Gohome point location.
Same As From—Uses the specified From point location as the Gohome point location.
GOHOME - No Point—Uses the GOHOME move defined in the postprocessor. The default value is (0,0,0). The point is not displayed in the tool path.
Specify—Sets the Gohome point location. You can either select a predefined point or use the Point Constructor to specify a point.
Tool Axis
None—Sets the From Point tool axis to 0,0,1.
Specify—Sets the Tool axis orientation. You can either select geometry or use the Vector Constructor to orient the tool axis.
Transfer/Rapid
Part Safe Clearance
Defines an additional clearance that the non-cutting portions of the tool may not encroach.
Common Clearance
Clearance Option
Use Inherited—Selects the clearance plane specified at the MCS level.
Plane—Specifies the clearance plane for this operation.
Transfer/Rapid
Smooth Transfer Move Corners
Applies smoothing between transfer moves and adjacent approach or departure moves.
Smooth Transfer Move Corners
Available when you select the Smooth Transfer Move Corners check box.
This is the dimension that NX applies to the smooth path. You can specify either the radius value in the current units, for example, mm, or a percentage of the tool's diameter (% Tool Diameter).
Tolerance
Sets the allowed deviation of the output linear moves from a calculated smooth spline. As the tolerance decreases, the number of output steps in the tool path increases and the motion becomes smoother.
From Cutting—Uses the specified Intol and Outtol values for cutting moves to control the number of straight steps required for the stepover. Output is typically a lot of lines of code with very smooth motion. This method is recommended for multi-axis operations.
Specify—Lets you specify a smoothing tolerance that generates the number of straight steps that you find acceptable. Use this method if the other two options do not satisfy your needs.
More
Check for Non Cutting Collisions

A single operation from the operation dialog box.
One or more operations from the following locations:
Operation Navigator
Home tab→Operations group
Menu→Tools
You must wait for the operations to finish generating before you can continue working.
One or more operations in the background as a parallel process while you continue working in the current part file. The Generate in Background command is available in the same locations as the Generate command.
A single operation or group in the background as a batch process. You must close the part file associated with the batch process. You can work in another part file while the batch process runs. You can reopen the part file associated with the batch process only after the batch process is complete.
Generating changed operations only
When you generate multiple operations within a program group, you can choose to generate only the operations that are changed. You exclude operations with up-to-date tool paths with a status of either Complete or Repost .
To enable this functionality, set the Force Regerate customer default or manufacturing preference.
Tip:
To find a customer default, choose File tab→Utilities→Customer Defaults, and click Find Default .
In cases where separate operations share the same blank and therefore have an IPW relationship, if one of the operations has an out-of-date tool path, NX generates all the operations.

Running a batch process in the background
When you run a batch process with the Background option:
The batch process automatically saves the part file when it is complete.
For the best results, do not continue working on the submitted part while batch processing runs in the background, because the batch process can overwrite your changes, or you could overwrite the batch process changes.
The batch process generates a log file with a name that has your part name and a .log extension, for example my_part.log. This log file contains information about the selected operations and groups, start time, end time, and whether the process is successful or not. You can check the log file to see the status of a batch process running in the background.
The batch process sends an e-mail with the log information to you when the processing is complete.

Pattern allows you to display a tool holder during tool path Generation and Replay. You can design a tool holder in the Modeling Application, save it as a Pattern, and then use it in the operation to visually check for interference with the part during machining.
To create a Pattern, you must first start a part file and then design the tool holder. For the part file to be used in Manufacturing as a Pattern, you must specify that it be saved as Pattern Data as follows:
File→Options→Save Options. . .→Pattern Data Only
You must then save the part file:
File→Save→Part
When you Generate the tool path, the system retrieves the specified Pattern, positions the origin point of the Pattern on the Tool Alignment Point, and aligns the Work Coordinates of the Pattern with the Machine Coordinates of the part as illustrated in the following figure.
The Tool Alignment Point is calculated for Mill tools and Lathe tools as follows:
Mill - The Tool Alignment Point is calculated as the Display Tool Height (Z Delta) distance from the centerline bottom of the tool as illustrated below.
Pattern and Mill Tool Alignment
Lathe - The Tool Alignment Point is calculated as the Display Tool Length (X Delta) and the Display Tool Width (Y Delta) distance from the cutting tip of the tool. This point is the corner of the tool that is opposite to the cutter. For groove tools, it is the corner opposite the Tool Track At position as illustrated below.
Pattern and Lathe Tool Alignment
In both cases, you should be aware of the alignment position when you establish the origin of the Pattern when using the X Delta, Y Delta, and Z Delta default values.
You can shift the position of the Pattern in relation to the Tool Alignment Point by adjusting the X Delta, Y Delta, and Z Delta values under the Specify option (described below). This enables you to avoid gouging the part with the Pattern.
Note:
By design, the system does not automatically flip a lathe tool pattern based on the type of work (ID/OD) or the side of the centerline on which the tool path lies (unlike normal tool display). Instead, the system aligns the MCS of the Pattern file with the MCS of the work part and displays the Pattern accordingly. To display a tool pattern in the 4th quadrant of the work part, the user must set the MCS of the Pattern file such that the tool pattern is at the proper orientation in the 4th quadrant.
Specify
Specify enables you to select the desired Pattern, define the display frequency of the Pattern, and shift the position of the Pattern in relation to the Tool Alignment Point by adjusting the X Delta, Y Delta, and Z Delta values.
Pattern File
Pattern File enables you to designate the desired Pattern by keying in an existing part file name or selecting from a list of part files. (the part file must be saved as Pattern Data). Although the Selection field in the subsequent dialog box will accomodate as many characters as you need to designate the desired Pattern, the system only reads up to 31 characters. If the specified part file is in the current folder, the part file name may contain up to 31 characters. If the specified part is not in the current folder, the sum of characters in the path name and the part file name may contain up to 31 characters.

The tool axis and end point display are permanent until you turn the option off.
You can visually evaluate the tool axis in the tool path at specific locations or by observing the tool axis progressions. These progressions can be on cutting motions on the machining surfaces or on non-cutting motions in the air. For example, the displayed tool axis could show progression around the fillets or corners, alignment with respect to curved surfaces, or a change of alignment between two cutting surfaces during non-cutting motions. Tool Axis at End Point is especially useful for five-axis machining.
Use Tool Axis at End Point with other commands to help you evaluate the display. You can do the following:

https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid1022766,Automating manufacturing process documents,"The time that you spend on manually generating NC job process sheets could be as much as half the total time required to create a complete NC package. To maintain the process sheets you must manually synchronize multiple inputs and this process can be error prone. It is also easy to overlook automatic changes to the NC program. To create job process sheets that NX can automatically update, use the Documentation operation or the Author Work Instructions command.
In a typical workflow you create a Documentation operation where you create job process sheets with information such as setup instructions, a tool list, and an operation list for the overall program. You place the Documentation operation at the beginning of the program. You then use the Author Work Instructions command to create and attach job process sheets to individual CAM operations. NX updates all associative data in your job process sheets, for example:
Drafting sheets
Tool information
Tool and operation lists
MOM variables
Lightweight section views
When your workflow is complete, you can publish the job process sheets as PDF or HTML files. When you select a program to publish the work instructions, NX adds all of the process sheets in their program order, and links them to the table of contents. You can select a single operation to publish only the process sheets required by that operation.
Operation Navigator
There is a separate column in the Operation Navigator to show you which operations have work instructions assigned to them. In the following example, the GENERAL_SETUP operation is a Documentation operation. Work instructions are added to the CAVITY_MILL and FLOOR_WALL_IPW operations using the Work Instructions command.

Within a template file, the OWI_ commands call the different sheet components. To include multiple instances of the same component, number the components sequentially. For example, if you need a text block, enter OWI_TEXT_1 in a cell. If you need three text blocks, enter OWI_TEXT_1, OWI_TEXT_2, and OWI_TEXT_3 in their respective cells.
OWI_DWG_1
Inserts a drawing component.
OWI_OPER_LIST_1
Inserts an operation list.
OWI_PATH_VIEW_1
Inserts a captured camera view that includes the tool path.
OWI_PROD_VIEW_1
Inserts a captured camera view of the manufacturing setup.
OWI_TEXT_1
Inserts a text block where the user can enter text, insert mom variables, insert hyperlinks, or insert text from a file.
OWI_TOOL_LIST_1
Inserts a tool list.
OWI_IMAGE_1
Inserts an image file that the user selects. Supported file types are .bmp, .jpg, .gif, .png, and .tif.
${mom_owi_manual_time}
Inserts the time entered in the Estimated Time to Complete Task box of the Documentation dialog box.
${mom_attr_PART_PARTNUM}>OP:${mom_attr_PART_MFG_OP}
Inserts the PARTNUM and PART_MFG_OP attributes. You can delete this command if you do not use the attributes.
mom_attr commands extract attributes defined for your part in the Displayed Part Properties dialog box.
Tip:
To view the part attributes:
Assembly Navigator,→right-click the setup assembly→Properties→Attributes tab
###xx###
Indicates a sheet formatting command.
${}
Indicates a call to a mom variable.
Example Excel template file
This example shows the contents of the owi_template_tool_list_by_name.xlsx file for the Tool List by Name template. Sheet formatting commands appear in red text.
###PAGE_CONTENT_LENGTH###, 9, IN
Sets the page length at 9 inches. The valid length units are IN and MM.
###REPEAT_TITLE###, No
Specifies that only the contents between ###BODY_START### and ###TITLE_START### are repeated at the top of each page. For this example, the sheet title is repeated. If you enter Yes, everything between ###TITLE_START### and ###TABLE_START### is also repeated at the top of each page.
The code between ###TITLE_START### and ###TABLE_START### is considered the title section of the template.
Path Image
The path_image.png file is a placeholder image for the OWI_PROD_VIEW, OWI_PATH_VIEW, and OWI_DWG components. The graphic in the template must fit within the borders of the cell or merged cells where you insert it. This is so that the captured camera view or drawing also fits within the assigned borders in the work instruction sheet.
For this tool list example, NX repeats everything between ###TABLE_START### and ###TABLE_END### for each tool. In an operation list sheet, NX repeats the code for each operation.
There are formatting requirements for the operation list and tool list table row. The first column must be one of the following:
Index, my_index
Operation Name, mom_operation_name
Tool Name, mom_tool_name
Tool Number, mom_tool_number
If you do not use Index, then the first column is the table key. For example, if the first column contains mom_tool_name, then mom_operation_name lists all operations that use that tool.
If the first column is Index, then the second column is the table key and must contain one of the following:
mom_operation_name
mom_tool_name
mom_tool_number

Operations List
Produces a report for each program in the Program Order View of the Operation Navigator. The report lists operation names, descriptions of the operations, and the names of the tools used in each operation. You can generate the report in either text or HTML format. This report can help a machinist prepare the job.
Tool List
Produces a report of the tools that were imported into the NC program from the tool library and that are visible in the Machine Tool View of the Operation Navigator. The report includes the data within each tool. You can generate the report in either text or HTML format. This report helps the NC Programmer identify the tools that are available for an NC Program.
Note:
Some of the listed tools may not be used in operations.
Operation List by Method
Produces a report on the operations as they appear in the Machine Method View of the Operation Navigator. The report lists the operations in sequence. You can generate the report in either a text or HTML format. This report can be used for reviewing your NC program.
Unique Tool List by Program
Produces a report only on the tools that are used to machine the part in each program. These tools and their data are listed in the order that they are used. Each tool is listed only once, even if it is used in more than one operation in a program. Tools that are not used in machining the part are not listed.
You can generate the report in either text or HTML format. This report can be useful for machinists and tool crib personal to prepare the needed tools for setup.
Advanced Operations List
Produces a report that is similar to the report produced by the Operations List template, except that a graphical image of each operation is added. You can generate the report in HTML format only.
Note:
Before you select Advanced Operations List, be sure to size the graphic window and orient the part so that it is not obstructed by the Operation Navigator or anything else in the window.
Tools and Operations
Produces a report that lists the tools in the part file, and the operations in which each tool was used in the actual NC program. You can generate the report in HTML format only. This report can help a machinist get a better understanding of knowing what tool is associated with what operation.
Advanced Web Page
Produces a report that can be used as a setup sheet that provides images of each tool path, and a page of parameters for each tool. The setup sheet takes information from all of the views of the Operation Navigator. The report can be output in HTML format only. This is a sample of a framed web page that can be used as the basis for customization. You may want the output to go to a separate folder, since many files may be created. You need to open the created file in your local web browser to view the output. This web page provides details for the machinist about how a job can be prepared.
Note:
Before running the Advanced Web Page option, be sure to size the graphic window and orient the part so that the graphic is not obstructed by the Operation Navigator or anything else in the window.
Advanced Web Page Mill Turn
Produces a report similar to the Advanced Web Page, plus it includes additional tool parameters for Turning tools. This report can help a machinist prepare the job.
Export Tool Library to ASCII datafile
Use to create an ASCII tool library file containing all the tools in the part. If you were previously using part files as your tool libraries, this option will help you convert your library to a text file. This file can be used as a library, or the content can be pasted into an existing tool library file. The location of the library file that is created is determined by the template, and is displayed in the listing device. Further instructions are represented in the Listing dialog.
Note:
The Export Tool Library to ASCII datafile functionality was written as a converter for pre-V16 tools. We do not maintain it for later releases. Therefore, parameters added in later releases are not supported by the datafile. For example, the 'Size' (IC) parameter was introduced in V18 and ASCII export does not supported it."

Making Changes To The File
If you rearrange, add, delete, or comment out items from this file, it will change the display order in the Report Format list on the Shop Documentation dialog box. For example, if the Tool List (HTML) preformatted template  is never used by your company, just delete it or comment it out from this list in the shop_doc.dat file and it no will longer appear in the Report Format list on the Shop Documentation dialog box dialog.
For each pre-formatted template in the shop_doc.dat, two files are specified: the Template File, and the Event Handler. The Template file can be identified by the extension .tpl and the Event Handler can be identified by the extension .tcl. All of these Template files and Event Handler files as well as the shop_doc.dat files must be located in the shop_doc_folder or contain complete file paths. The following are some suggestions for customization:
To make small changes to an existing format, you can edit the existing Template file.
For larger changes you can make a copy of the Event Handler and Template file and add a new entry to the .dat file. Then make a change to the copies.
Note:
WARNING: Prior to the first time you customize any files make a copy of the entire shop_doc folder and give it a different name. All customizing changes should be made in this new folder. Otherwise, when a new version of NX is loaded, it overrides all your customized changes. Update the environment variable in the ugii environment file to point to your new folder.
Configuration File
To customize the available formats in the Shop Documentation scroll bar, make all your changes in shop_doc.dat file.
Warning:
WARNING: Remember, if you are making any changes in the dialog it is easiest to keep all the Template and Event Handler files in the shop_doc folder. If you do not do this, you will receive an error and your customizations will not work."

The Event Handler allows for logic programming where you can redefine what actions take place for each event. The Event Handler provided in the standard NX installation provides generally accepted actions for most machining events and therefore does not usually need customization. We suggest that you do not customize in this file unless you require complex changes and you are experienced in Tcl.
Customization of Shop Documentation can be done completely in the Template file, or it can be done in both the Template file and the Event Handler. But Customization cannot be done completely in the Event Handler.
Unlike the Template file, the Event Handler contains only valid Tcl commands. These can be standard Tcl commands or MOM extensions to Tcl. The Event Handler gives additional support to the Template file when there is a large amount of logic involved in the document. If your customization requires a large amount of detailed instructions, and you are experienced in Tcl, the customization can be done in the Event Handler. This way the Template File does not become too difficult to read with too many detailed instructions.
For more information on the MOM extensions to Tcl see Commands."

When you use Tcl commands you must enclose them in brackets [...]. These commands can be standard Tcl, or MOM extensions. MOM extension commands all begin with MOM_. The three main MOM extension commands are: MOM_cycle_object, MOM_list_oper_path, and MOM_do_template_file.
MOM_cycle_object
This is the most essential MOM command. Click the link to learn more about it.
MOM_list_oper_path <operation_name> <event_handler> <definition_file> <output_file>
This command lists the tool path of an operation. It allows you to customize how the tool paths are listed.
This command allows you to postprocess an operation using an existing postprocessor (Tcl and Def file). You can use it to include the actual machine code in the output, or to capture the output of user defined events. If the output file is not specified, the system uses the output file.
Here is an example of its use to list a path in the CLSF format:
set list_tcl [MOM_ask_env_var UGII_CAM_TOOL_PATH_DIR]clsf.tcl
set list_def [MOM_ask_env_var UGII_CAM_TOOL_PATH_DIR]clsf.def
MOM_list_oper_path $mom_operation_name $list_tcl $list_def 
  MOM_do_template_file <template_file>
This command reads and evaluates a template file.
Note:
If you use HDRF='filename', BDYF='filename', or FTRF='filename' then MOM_do_template_file is invoked automatically with filename as its argument.

This command cycles through the currently active part file in an NX session to extract information about certain objects. The command_string specifies the objects search and specifies what to do with the information extracted. The object is always the first word in the command_string.
MOM_cycle_objects
MOM_cycle_objects is used to systematically search through the CAM objects in the setup. The objects can be cycled in any of the four views.
Object Retrieval
Based on the specified object type, MOM_cycle_objects loads all the parameters and attributes that belong to each object in a class.
Object Selection
The retrieved contents of each object may be subject to a selection process specified by a query expression. Only the object containing a parameter(s) or an attribute(s) that satisfies the query criteria is passed onto the next step.
Data Enhancement
In addition to the default contents, the information of each object may be enhanced by deriving new data from the existing one based on the specified instruction (Header Body Footer).
Presentation
This is the end result of all of the format choices you have made.  The information is generally divided into header, body and footer. The header section contains the introductory statements regarding a particular class of objects. The body section contains the detailed description of each individual object. And the footer section presents the ending statements about this class of interest.
Syntax of MOM_cycle_objects
Object Retrieval is conducted based on the specified object type. Object Selection, Data Enhancement, and Presentation is performed based on a list of keywords. The syntax of the command is shown in the following section.
When you expand the command string and cycle multiple objects you receive a command format that is displayed below:
MOM_cycle_objects 
   {object_type keyword=string keyword=string  
       {object_type keyword=string keyword=string  
           {object_type keyword=string keyword=string  
                {...
                }
           }
       }
   }
Object Types
The system defines object types for the setup, for each view, and for most of the objects that the system can encounter while cycling. In general, the system starts cycling at the setup level and then proceeds to one of the four views. From there it cycles for specific object types or for MEMBERS, depending on the command string.  
Although the system cycles all objects, it can only use these object types in the command:
SETUP
PROGRAMVIEW
GEOMVIEW
METHODVIEW
MACHVIEW
MEMBERS
OPER
TOOL
If you use MEMBERS all objects at the current level are cycled regardless of their type. For example, if the object is a group, then its members are cycled. When all the members of the group have been cycled, then each member within each member of the group is cycled. The system continues cycling until all the objects are cycled.
When you use members, since any object type can be found, use the special tcl procedures for each object, as shown in the MOM_cycle_objects procedures chart.  
For more information, please read more about object types.
Keywords
Default Header, Body and Footer Procedures
During the execution of MOM_cycle_objects, the following event handlers (Tcl procedures), if supplied, are triggered automatically for each object type to present the header, body and footer descriptions:
proc MOM_objectType_HDR (Header)
proc MOM_objectType_BODY (Body)
proc MOM_objectType_FTR (Footer)
The object type can be any of those found in mom_rm_names.c. You have to supply all the necessary event handlers for the object types being interrogated.
These default headers, bodies and footers, if present, are executed before the ones specified by using the keywords (HDRT, BDYT and FTRT) discussed in the Keywords section.
Note:
The Unused Items group is a special system group and is not cycled like other MEMBERS.
Object Hierarchy
The hierarchy of the CAM objects dictates the types of sub-objects that are interrogated under certain object types. This hierarchy is best seen by looking in the Operation Navigator.
We see in the Operation Navigator that in a given SETUP there are four views: Program Order View, Machine Tool View, Geometry View, and Machining Method View, which correspond to views organized by the Program, Method, Geometry and Machine Tools respectively. In each view there are a variety of object types that may appear. For example, in Machine Tool View we have a Machine Tool. Under Machine Tool are Cutting Tools, and under Cutting tools are the operations.
Operation Navigator ->Machine Tool View or the Tool View Icon
Use the Operation Navigator to view the hierarchy and its various creation dialogs to determine exactly which object types can appear in a view and how those object types may be arranged with respect to each other.
Tables
A common format for Shop Documentation is tables. Tables within the documentation are defined in three sections: header, body, and footer. The header and footer are usually constant titles for the tables and therefore you can use literals. The body includes the variable data in the table. Because the data changes in this case, you can use the Tcl commands."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/mainmenu_main_shop_keywords,Keywords,"With each object type you can use optional keywords. Each keyword is assigned a string. Multiple keywords should be separated with a space.
The chart below lists the valid keywords:
QRY
This defines a query to limit the scope of selected objects.
INST
This defines special instructions for the object that is being cycled.
HDRT
Text output when cycling of this object type starts.
BDYT
Text output for each object cycled.
FTRT
Text output when cycling of this object type ends.
HDRF
File containing output when cycling of this object type starts.
BDYF
File containing output for each object cycled.
FTRF
File output when cycling of this object type ends.
When objects are cycled, output can be controlled in three ways.
Header, Body and Footer text (HDRT, BDYT, FTRT).
Header, Body and Footer text from an external file (HDRF, BDYF, FTRF).
Object Header Body and Footer procedures in the Event Handler.
The first two options (which use HDRT, BDYT, FTRT, HDRF, BDYF, FTRF) are available for each object that is encountered while cycling.
For the third option only certain procedures are called, depending on what object you have encountered while cycling. These procedures are named MOM_<object_type>_HDR, MOM_<object_type>_BODY and MOM_<object_type>_FTR.
The HDR and FTR procedures are called if the object type is in the command. The BODY procedure is called for every object that is encountered. For example, if you cycle MEMBERS, MOM_MEMBERS_HDR is called for the beginning of the first member. Then MOM_OPER_BODY is called for each OPER encountered, and MOM_MEMBERS_FTR is called at the end of the last member.
If you cycle OPERs, then MOM_OPER_HDR is called for the first OPER, MOM_OPER_BODY is called for each OPER, and MOM_OPER_FTR is called after the last OPER.
For more information see Header, Body, Footer.

The object type specifies what type of objects are to be interrogated. Some examples of object types are listed below:
SETUP
PROGRAMVIEW
METHODVIEW
GEOMVIEW
MACHVIEW
OPER
TOOL
MEMBERS
Objects reside in different classes within the hierarchy and are interrogated in a nested fashion as shown below:
{ ... {objectType1 {objectType2} ... }.
ObjectType2 is nested in objectType1.
{SETUP {MACHVIEW {TOOL}}}
TOOL is nested in MACHVIEW, which is nested in SETUP.
This command asks for all the TOOLs in the MACHVIEW (Tool View) of the SETUP, whether they are used by an operation or not.
The use of MEMBERS allows for general, flexible MOM_cycle_objects arguments that can handle a variety of NX data hierarchies. Nest MEMBERS inside an object type to see all the members that belong to that object type, as shown below:
{SETUP {PROGRAMVIEW {MEMBERS}}}
This command asks for all the members that belong to PROGRAMVIEW.
The meaning of MEMBERS depends on the object type, as shown below.
{SETUP {PROGRAMVIEW {MEMBERS {OPER {TOOL}}}}}
The SETUP is comprised of many programs. If MEMBERS appears in the MOM_cycle_objects argument, the command cycles through each individual program searching for all the MEMBERS within each program. In this case MEMBERS includes:
Groups of operations within the programs
Each individual operation within the groups of operations
The tools within each operation
In this example, when the software searches for MEMBERS, it:
Searches for all program groups that are under the PROGRAMVIEW root.
Searches for any OPERs that are contained in each program group.
Searches for all the tools in the operations.
In any view, when OPERs are cycled, the TOOL used by the OPER can be cycled. If MEMBERS are cycled, and the member is an operation, the tool is cycled. If the member is not an OPER, no tool is available, and the cycling continues as shown below.
[ MOM_cycle_objects { SETUP { PROGRAMVIEW { MEMBERS { TOOL } } } } ]
This example cycles all the members in the program view, looking for tools."

A QRY expression may contain multiple relational expressions combined with logical operators. The syntax is as follows:
QRY='relational_exp logical_oprelational_exp . . .'
The logical operator (logical_op) can be either && (logical-AND) or || (logical-OR).
Each relational expression (relational_exp) is defined below:
[source_operand] relational_op[target_operand]
 The available relational operators (relational_op) are listed below:
Operator

greater
>=
greater or equal

less
<=
less or equal
==

The source_operand is an expression containing Tcl variable(s). Both source_operand and target_operand should be enclosed in a pair of square brackets [...]. When a string comparison (&= or &!) is performed, the target_operand should follow the syntax of the Regular Expressions in Tcl.
The following example extracts the information about a list of tools with names starting with T and diameter greater than 0.5:

       {TOOL
        QRY='[$mom_tool_name] &= [^T.*$] &&[$mom_tool_diameter] > [0.5]'        } ]
Only the retrieved parameters and attributes that belong to the default contents of an object may be subject to the query examination. The enhanced data such as tool path Max/Min box or Start and End positions may not be used in the query expression.
Note:
The MOM variables containing the retrieve parameters and attributes for each object can be viewed using the Review Tool."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/mainmenu_main_instruction,Instruction,"INST (instruction) specifies special actions the system performs on each object. The instructions generally produce additional information from the existing default contents of an object. Enhanced information, such as an image file of the geometry or the machining time of a tool path, may also be presented in a document.
The following instructions have been implemented for different object types in CAM:
Object Type
Instruction
Definition
SETUP
PART_GIF
PART_GIF  generates an image file, in .gif format, of the part geometry of the setup. The variable $mom_setup_part_gif_file contains the name of the .gif file
OPER
PATH_GIF
GEOM_GIF
PATH_GIF generates an image file of the operation's tool path. This instruction causes an existing tool path to be replayed automatically. The variable $mom_operation_path_gif_file contains the name of the file.
GEOM_GIF generates an image file of the geometry used in an operation. The variable $mom_operation_geometry_gif_file contains the name of the file.
Note:
When using GEOM_GIF the system captures the images without refreshing the display. When using PATH_GIF the system refreshes the display and the replays the tool path before capturing the image. Therefore, if you are using both instructions, use the GEOM_GIF instruction first.
The following example extracts the information about the operations and generates a .gif file for each tool path:
[MOM_cycle_objects {OPER INST='PATH_GIF' }]
You can specify that multiple instruction tokens serve the same object type in an INST expression to perform various actions while cycling through a class of objects. Separate tokens with spaces or commas."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/mainmenu_main_head_body_footer,"Header, Body, Footer","The presentation format for the object class information can be described in terms of Header, Body, and Footer. When the classes of objects in different hierarchy are interrogated recursively, the presentation of the data can be illustrated as follows:
MOM_cycle_objects command uses six keywords to accomplish this task of presenting the data:
HDRT HDRF (header)
BDYT BDYF (body)
FTRT FTRF (footer)
Here are some examples of how headers, bodies and footers are used. Note that we do not have SETUP body processors because a part has exactly one SETUP. Body processors are called for each object of the specified object type. If there is only one object of this type, you can either put the processor in the Header or Footer.
 [MOM_cycle_objects
      {SETUP HDRT='Setup for Part $mom_part_name' FTRT='End of Documentation for $mom_date'
           {OPER HDRT='These Operations are contained in this Setup'                 BDYT='Operation: $mom_oper_name'                 FTRT='End of Operations'
            }
      }
 ]
  In this case when MOM_cycle_objects executes, the following is executed automatically:
The variable $mom_part_name is translated, inserted into the HDRT for SETUP and then the HDRT for SETUP is printed.
The OPER's HDRT is printed.
For each operation in the Setup do
If the Tcl script contains a procedure named MOM_OPER_BODY then execute it.
Translate $mom_oper_name, insert into the OPER's BDYT and then print the OPER's BDYT.
Print the OPER's FTRT.
Translate $mom_date, insert into SETUP's FTRT and print the SETUP's FTRT.
Note that for Body processing the Tcl procedure, if it exists, is executed first followed by the BDYT or BDYF. Of course, you do not need a BDYF or BDYT. If you do not have an object type Body procedure or a BDYT or BDYF for that object then there is no output generated for that object type. This could be useful if you want all the TOOLs in a SETUP in the order in which they are used but did not want to see the operations in which they are used. If this were the case you could use something like the following and have an empty MOM_OPER_BODY Tcl procedure.
[MOM_cycle_objects
{SETUP 
  {OPER 
     {TOOL 
       HDRT='Tool Heading'
       BDYT='Tool Name: $mom_tool_name'
      }
   }
 }
]
 For an example of using MEMBERS consider the following:
 [MOM_cycle_objects
  {SETUP
    HDRT='CAM Part Dump for $mom_part_name
       {MEMBERS
         HDRT='This part contains the following:'
         BDYT='Object: $obj_type, $obj_type_name, $obj_name'
       }
   }
]
In this case when MOM_cycle_objects is executed the following is executed automatically:
Translate mom_part_name, insert into SETUP's HDRT and print the HDRT.
For the SETUP object:
Print the MEMBERS HDRT.
Get all the corresponding BODY that belongs to the MEMBER and for each of these objects:
Perform the Tcl procedure for the object type of this object.
Translate the variables obj_type, obj_type_name and obj_name, insert them into the MEMBERS BDYT and print the MEMBERS BDYT.
Let OBJECT be the current object and repeat all the steps within step 2.
Note:
Note that in step 2, if the current object is of type OPER then the Tcl procedure MOM_OPER_BODY is executed. If it is of type TOOL then MOM_TOOL_BODY is executed. These procedures exist in the Tcl script whose name is supplied in the CAM configuration file.
Note:
Since the Tcl procedure is executed first, you can define variables in the Tcl procedure and then use them in the BDYT text."

If you do not specify an extension, the system uses txt by default and no file extension is displayed in the dialog. Specify the extension in the Event Handler and Definition file.
To set your own file extension use the method below.
In the beginning of the Event Handler (.tcl), insert the following commands:
set mom_source_directory [MOM_ask_env_var UGII_CAM_SHOP_DOC_DIR]
source ""$mom_source_directory/shopdoc_header.tcl""

https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/mainmenu_main_mom_vari,MOM Variables,"MOM variables are dynamic, and change based on the operation. They may be added or changed with each release.
Note:
Some variables related directly to the tool path are available only during postprocessing, and are not available in Shop Documentation. If you need to use these, you should use the postprocessor to generate your shop documentation.
There are many variables available while a shop document is being generated. Different variables are available, depending on what objects are being cycled. For example, mom_tool_diameter is available for a milling tool, but would not be applicable for another object, such as a program or operation. The list on the second sheet of the spreadsheet is for reference only. You can use variable names there for copy and paste if they are applicable to your operation.
Attributes
The system assigns mom variables so that you can access attributes. These variables are named as shown in the table below where <name> represents the original attribute name.
Mom Variable
Event
Class
Description
mom_attr_PROGRAMVIEW_<name>
MOM_PROGRAM_BODY
Attribute
User defined program group attributes.
mom_attr_TOOL_<name>
MOM_TOOL_HDR
Attribute
User defined tool attributes.
mom_attr_OPER_<name>
MOM_MEMBERS_HDR
Attribute
User defined operation attributes.
mom_attr_PART_<name>
MOM_Part_Documentation
Attribute
User defined part attributes.
Review Tool
The best way to determine the available variables is to use the review tool. To activate the review tool, select On from the Review Tool list in the :Settings group of the Postprocess dialog box,
When you output a Shop Documentation, there is some delay, and then the review tool begins with three columns.
Column one displays all the events that were generated.
Choose an event in column one, and column two displays the variables set by that event.
Column three is used only for Post, and can be ignored.
Generating Shop documentation also produces a debug file which contains a list of all events generated and all the mom variables that were set by the events.  When you are finished debugging your Shop Document, simply comment out the above lines in the Tcl file.
When debug mode is on, an additional file <unique_name>_debug.out is generated, containing a log of all events that were generated, and all the mom variables that were set by the events. The following sample is a portion of the file, showing the variables set for a tool header event.

The word following the DB_ID keyword is the unique attribute name that appears in FORMAT statements in the database.
DB_ID_TYPE <type identifier>
Valid type identifiers include:
d
A floating point decimal number
i
An integer
s
A text string
OPTIONS
An optional keyword that you can use to provide a list of valid values. This list appears in the Search Criteria dialog box using the same text or values that you provide.
OPTIONS_IDS
This keyword must appear if the OPTIONS keyword is used, but not without it. In the column for the attribute DB_ID, provide a list of values to appear in DATA statements in the database, . The list must be ordered the same as the corresponding list after the OPTIONS keyword.
DIALOG_NAME “<title>”
The title that you provide appears in the Search Criteria dialog box.
RSET_NAME “<title>”
The title that you provide appears in the Search Result dialog box.
#
The # symbol denotes a comment line. Do not use comments inside the DB_ALIAS alias { } structure. You can use comments before a definition structure to explain its purpose.

To define the attribute for cutter flute direction, with the column title FD in FORMAT statements in the tool_database.dat files, and the alias FluteDirection, we use this code format:
        DB_ALIAS  FluteDirection
        {
           DB_ID       FD 
           DB_ID_TYPE   s

           OPTIONS_IDS ""R"" ""L""
           DIALOG_NAME ""Flute Direction""
           RSET_NAME   ""Flute Direction""
        }
To define the attribute for cutter flute length, with the column title FLEN in FORMAT statements in the tool_database.dat files, and the alias FluteLength, we use this code format:
        DB_ALIAS  FluteLength
        {
           DB_ID       FLEN 
           DB_ID_TYPE   d
           DIALOG_NAME ""(FL) Flute Length""
           RSET_NAME ""(FL) Flute Length""
        }
To define the attribute for the number of cutter flutes, with the column title FN in FORMAT statements in the tool_database.dat files, and the alias NumberOfFlutes, we use this code format:
        DB_ALIAS  NumberOfFlutes
        {
           DB_ID       FN 
           DB_ID_TYPE   i
           DIALOG_NAME ""Number of Flutes""
           RSET_NAME   ""Number of Flutes""

The Class Hierarchy section is at the end of the definition file.
The class hierarchy is a structure that shows the types and subtypes of data in the library, tools, holders, or devices. Types and subtypes have almost the same format, with the exception that subtypes are included in type definitions.
In this example, before the closing brace of CLASS TOOL, a few classes beginning with CLASS MILLING are defined. Before the closing brace of CLASS MILLING, several classes, beginning with CLASS END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE are defined.

All three libraries have the same structure, and you use and customize them in the same way.
When you use the libraries, you can define a tool once, and reuse the definition whenever you need it.
When you retrieve objects from a library, you:
Specify a classification, such as mill, turning tool, or drill.
Specify parameters to filter the results, such as diameter, length, or tip angle.
Select a tool, holder, or device that matches your criteria.
Cutting tool libraries
A cutting tool library classifies cutting tools and stores tool parameters. NX uses these parameters to display standard tools and calculate material removal in simulations. A solid model of a standard tool need not exist. Use the solid tool library if the dimensions are non-standard.
If a cutting tool has a holder defined, NX loads the tool holder when it loads the tool.
Cutting tools can have an optional associated part file which NX can use to display a tool. This is usually an assembly of the components used to make up a tool, such as tool and holder, cutting inserts, and so on. The graphics folder of the tool library, $UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_DIR\tool\graphics, contains several examples of cutting tools.
   ugt0202_001      ugt0102_008         ugt0101_001
Tool holder libraries
A tool holder library stores definitions for parametric tool holders for milling, drilling, and turning tools. You can save holders to a holder library by exporting them from the Holder tab of the tool editing dialog box. On the same tab, you can retrieve a holder for use with a tool that you are editing. If there is a holder defined for a library tool, it is retrieved with the tool.
User-defined bull-nose cutter in user-defined holder
Solid tool libraries
A solid tool is a solid model or assembly that is used as a tool in a Generic Motion operation. The shape of the tool is defined by the solid model, and not by traditional parameters like diameter. For example, you may model probes, painting heads, or other similar devices. Tracking points determine what point on the solid follows the programmed path. All solid tools are library tools.
User-defined probing tools
If you have a tool that is not defined by the standard dimensions for tools and holders, you can create a model and define it as a solid tool. An NX part or assembly is added to a new folder in the $UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_DIR\tool\graphics folder.
Device libraries
A machine device is mounted on a machine tool to extend the range of actions that the machine can perform. Typical devices are turrets, heads, tail-stocks, steady-rests, parts catchers, tool calibration probes, or part transfer robots. The actions of a device are controlled in the NC program. You can store machine devices in a device library and retrieve them onto your machine in your CAM session.
You can retrieve a device to a specific pocket by selecting the pocket before you retrieve the device.

User-defined contouring head
Customization
You can extend the classifications, such as milling, drilling, chuck, and head. You can add the tools, holders, and devices that you use to the appropriate library. Tools and device part files contain kinematic information which defines their mounting position and orientation on the machine tool for simulation. You use the Machine Tool Builder application to define the tool mount and device mount junctions. For tool carrier devices such as heads, you can define an additional pocket component with a junction for the placement of the cutting tool.

Two points in space locate the tool with respect to the machine:
A reference point on the turret face that will move to programmed coordinates in the absence of any offsets.
In NX, you identify this point as the tool mount junction. The axes of the tool assembly, the tool mount junction, and the tool tip junction are coplanar in the XY plane of the tool assembly. For consistency with milling kinematics, we recommend that the X-axis points in the direction in which the tool, holder, device, or insert is moved into the object that holds it. For turrets of all types, this direction is typically radial towards the centerline.
A point at the tool tip, which must be one of 9 possible tracking points.
In NX, you identify this point as the tool tip junction.
Tracking point locations
The machine operator can measure points where the tool contacts the workpiece along the X-axis and Z-axis of the machine. The operator will use this information to provide offset information to adjust the machine’s positioning from the tool mount reference point to the tool tip reference point.
Tracking point numbers
Tracking point P9 is the center point of the radius at the nose of the tool.
The tool tip junction usually coincides with one of the turning tracking points P1 through P8.
The tool tip junction and the tool mount junction must be coplanar with the XY plane of the tool holder and must lie at Z=0.
To calculate the correct position of the tracking points, the junctions must be oriented by the rule shown in the following image, where the X-axis and Y-axis are the same as the tool mount junction in the assembly.
The arc:
Is concentric with the tool tip radius.
Is equal in radius to the tool tip radius.
A box that is aligned with the X and Y axes of the tool assembly (see Create a solid turning tool assembly for export to a library) is constructed such that it is tangent to the arc at the center points of all four sides, as shown.
The corner points of the box are numbered counterclockwise, starting with the point that is on the upper right when the axes are aligned as shown.
The tangent points are numbered counterclockwise starting with the point on the X+ axis of the box, tracking point P5, as shown.
Tracking points for grooving tools
The user must define the P number for radius R1 and set the tool tip junction (with the correct orientation) to the correct position at radius R1.
NX automatically calculates the tracking point for radius R2, according to the tool tip junctions and the tool parameters.
Note:
For grooving tools the tool tip junction must be defined.

This is a fully customizable dialog (see Customizing the Search Criteria Dialog). The following is an explanation of the most commonly found items in the dialog.
Search Criteria
Legend
This sketch outlines the parameters found in all items in the subclass. It is a visual aid in inputting the parameters for the search.
Library Units
The ASCII database is divided into English and metric units. Here you may select which you would like to use.
Various Parameters and Input Fields
The search will be limited by your entries into these fields.
Description
Lets you search for tools by entering a text string. NX returns tools with descriptions that contain the text. It is not necessary to enter operators or wild cards.
Additional Search Criteria
You can specify ranges of values or specific parameters not found in the dialog.
List Results
Result Info provides you with an information window which lists all the parameters which appear in the Search Criteria Dialog and their values. This function is not available until Count Matches has been performed.
Clear Query
You can remove all entries in the Search Criteria Dialog by using the Clear button.
Count Matches
By pressing the Count Matches button, the system will return the number of items in the database which match the search criteria which you have entered. If you enter no search criteria, pushing the Count Matches button will return the number of all the items in that subclass.
Additional Search Criteria
You can input an entire query string in this field. Each query string consists of a series of search criteria which are joined by logical operators ""and"" (&&) and ""or"" ( || ). These search strings must follow an exact syntax. For example:
[DB(alias_1)] c.op. [value] l.op. [DB(alias_2)] c.op.[value]
where:
alias_1 and alias_2
the names of the DB alias (the parameters) as they are found in the definition file of the corresponding DBC event handler (.def file).
c.op
comparable operators : <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
l.op
logical operators: and (`&&), or ( || )
For example, a search query based on the following string
[DB(Diameter)] < [.5] && [DB(Diameter)] > [0.2]
would produce a range of values where the diameter lies between 0.2 and 0.5 mm.
Range of Values
When inputting information into the Search Criteria Dialog, the system allows you to input a range of values. The syntax for these ranges is as follows:
Search Parameter Syntax
> x
Searches for all tools with a value greater than x
< x
Searches for all tools with a value less than x
x
Searches for all tools with a value equal to x"
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid813812,Create solid milling tool assembly for export to a library,"You can export a solid milling tool assembly, or solid drilling tool assembly, to a native NX or Teamcenter library.
You can start your milling tool assembly with a 3D model that you create or download.
If you download models from the tool vendor, you will probably have to rework or recreate the tool model to correct the orientation and the number of bodies in the part.
After you complete the tool assembly, all solid bodies should be in component part files, with no body in the assembly part file.
The assembly file name must be unique and must exactly match the libref of the tool in the tool database. For example, the graphics for the tool called ugt0201_096 would be in a file called ugt0201_096.prt. When you use this procedure, NX automatically names the part file or assembly file structure correctly.
Note:
When you use this method to export a tool assembly, the orientation of the base components with respect to the XY plane and origin of the absolute coordinate system of the part file are optional. However, it is recommend to follow these rules as a best practice.
Create one part file in NX and model the tool with two solid bodies in the XY plane. Make the tool axis parallel to the X-axis and the tool tip at the absolute origin of the part (X=0, Y=0 and Z=0).
Create the first solid body for the cutting portion.
Create a separate solid body for the non-cutting portion.
In the image, the yellow body is the cutting portion of the tool.
In a separate part file, model the tool holder in the XY plane, with the tool axis parallel to the X-axis and the spindle gauge point at the absolute origin of the part (X=0, Y=0 and Z=0).
During simulation, the gauge point is where the holder is aligned with the tool mount junction in the kinematic model of the machine tool. Typically, NX uses the center of the spindle face as the tool mount junction. It is often easiest to use the center of the mounting face as the gauge point; however, if you want extreme accuracy in the simulation, you can allow for the gap that may exist between the tool holder and the spindle face on the actual tool.
In the image, the origin is at the spindle gauge point.
In the image, the origin is adjusted for a gap between the holder face and the spindle face
Create a 3D tool assembly and save it in your working location.
To maintain Teamcenter compatibility, follow these rules:
Place no solid bodies in the tool assembly file.
Make the name of the tool assembly unique. This name must match the planned name for the tool in your library.
Make the first component the tool. This component should have two solid bodies for the cutting and non-cutting portions of the tool.
Make the second component the tool holder.
Add additional components if required. For example, you have the option to model screws, clamps, extensions, and so on.
Position the tool in the holder using a fixed location if so equipped, or using the recommended insertion depth.
Place all the geometry you want to be displayed in NX CAM on Layer 1.
In NX Manufacturing, add a CAM setup and create a parametric tool in the 3D tool assembly file.
The tool and holder parameters must exactly match the cutting and non-cutting parts of the 3D tool assembly that lie below the spindle gauge point in order to permit proper tool holder collision detection during simulation.
If you create the complete parametric tool component (not just the portion of the tool extended out from the holder), use the tool insertion offset parameter on the holder tab (OS) to match the distance the tool is set into the holder of the 3D tool assembly.
Note:
NX uses the parametric tool and holder to calculate tool motions and to check for collisions while generating a tool path. NX only uses the 3D tool assembly in machine simulation.
It is recommended to set the Tool Number value to 0 on the Tool tab of the tool dialog box.
When the tool is retrieved from the library, the tool number should not be the same number assigned to an existing tool in the setup.
In the Library group, in the Library Reference box, specify the library reference.
Select the Export Tool Part File check box.
Selecting this check box makes additional options visible on the tool tab to define the tool mount junction, tool tip junction and the cutting portion of the tool.
Note:
If you edit the tool assembly part of an existing tool in the library, then NX will select the Export Tool Part File check box by default.
Under Junctions, in the Specify Mounting row, click CSYS Dialog to define the tool mount junction.
Orient the X-axis of the junction in the direction the tool assembly mounts into the machine spindle.
Note:
For tool assemblies or devices that mount directly on a turret, the axes orientation and location of the tool mount junction must match the axes orientation and location of the tool mount junction defined on the turret in the machine model kinematics. It is recommended the X-axis points into the turret and the Y-axis is parallel to the XY-plane of the actual lathe workplane on the machine.


Under Junctions, in the Specify Tool Tip row, click CSYS Dialog to define the tool tip junction.
Orient the X-axis of the junction along the tool rotation axis.
Note:
On mill or mill-turn machines:
For milling tools with standard holders, the X-axes of the tool tip and tool mount junctions are collinear.
For milling tools with angled holders, the X-axis of the tool tip junction is equal to the escape direction of the tool from the holder.
Under Cutting Portion of Tool, click Select Object and select the solid body representing the cutting portion of the modeled tool.
Click Export Tool To Library .
All of these activities are done for milling tools at the time of export:
Creates a new entry in the tool database file.
Creates a new folder for the tool assembly in the tool graphics library location. The folder name is the same as the tool assembly file.
Creates a copy of the tool assembly file and the component files in the tool assembly folder.
Creates the tool kinematic structure in the tool assembly file that includes:
Tool mount and tool tip junctions.
Spin information for cutting and non-cutting bodies.
Creates revolved bodies in the tool assembly file for the cutting and non-cutting portions of the tool.
Note:
The tool graphics library location in NX is defined by the environment variable UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TOOL_GRAPHICS_PATH.
The default directory for the tool graphics library is MACH\resource\library\tool\graphics.
You can view the tool kinematic structure of the tool by opening the 3D tool assembly file located in the tool graphics library with Machine Tool Builder.
Close the 3D tool assembly file without saving it.
The current work part is no longer needed to define the library tool. If you need it for other purposes, you can save it somewhere in your local working environment.
Caution:
Do not save the work part manually in the MACH\resource\library\tool\graphics folder. NX automatically saved the part in the correct location when you exported the tool part file.
Test the tool assembly in a new CAM setup and create the tool from the library.
As soon as you click on the new tool in the machine tool view, it should display the tool assembly.
Check that the tool tip position and tool mount position are displayed correctly during machine simulation of a toolpath.
Note:
If you need to make a change to this library tool, edit the 3D tool assembly file in the tool graphics library."

Note:
If you download models from the tool vendor, you must rework or recreate the tool model to correct the orientation and the number of bodies in the part.
After you complete the tool assembly, all solid bodies should be in component part files, with no body in the assembly part file.
Align the tool assembly on the XY plane of the absolute coordinate system, with the XY plane of the tool mount and tool tip junctions coplanar at Z = 0.
Note:
In certain complex tools, the tool mount and the tool tip are not in the same plane. The general rule is that you must design the tool mount and tool tip junction in such a way that the XY plane of the tool tip junction is coplanar with the actual lathe workplane on the machine when the mounted tool is cutting.
Place the cutting portion of the tool in the first component part file.
If the tool has a non-cutting portion, for example, if an insert is permanently brazed onto a holder, model the non-cutting portion as a separate body and place it in the same component file.
Place a tool holder that accepts interchangeable tools in a second component part file.
(Optional) Place additional non-cutting bodies, such as tool extensions, clamping mechanisms, adapters, and so on, in other component part files.
Note:
Place all the geometry you want to be displayed in NX CAM on Layer 1.
If the tool tip edge is modeled as a spline or ellipse, construct an arc or circle to approximate its location.
The center of the arc is tracking point P9.
The image below shows the WCS at the P9 position. If you created a temporary arc, and you intend to identify P9 as the tracking point, create a point at WCS 0,0,0.
Start the Manufacturing application, and choose the cam_general configuration and the turning setup.
Define a parametric cutting tool that exactly matches the size and shape of the cutting portion of your tool assembly.
You can dynamically position the tool insert to verify when the parameters are correct.
If the display of the insert created by the tool dialog is inside the wrong plane, it is good practice to adjust the MCS inside the geometry view to match the plane of the 3D tool insert.
On the Tracking tab, create the tracking point for this tool, which is P4 in this example.
On the Holder tab, set the Holder Angle value to 0.0 and confirm that the Use Turn Holder check box is not selected.
On the Tool tab, adjust parameters as necessary to make the parametric tool exactly match the modeled tool.
Use analysis measurements, object information, and direct overlay to make sure the parameters are correct.
In the tool dialog box, click OK to complete the tool definition.
In the Machine Tool view of the Operation Navigator, verify that the tool name is correct and double-click the new tool to edit it.
On the Tool tab of the tool dialog box, in the Numbers Group, verify that the Tool Number value is set to 0.
In the Library group, in the Library Reference box, specify the library reference.
Select the Export Tool Part File check box.
Selecting this check box makes additional options available. You can now define the tool mount and tool tip junctions, and select the cutting portion of the tool.
Note:
Store the tool assembly part file you want to export in a location separate from the tools provided with your local NX installation.
If you edit the tool assembly part file of an already existing library tool, which is located in the mach\resource\library\tool\graphics folder, then only adjust the parameters of the mount and tool tip junction inside the Machine Tool Builder.
In this case the tool tip must reflect the correct tracking point. Export the tools in this case with theExport Tool Part File check box cleared, and save the part file.
Under Junctions, in the Specify Mounting row, click CSYS Dialog and specify the arc center of the cylinder that is inserted into the turret, as shown.
Tip:
You might need to set the Selection Scope value to Entire Assembly.
If the assembly is correctly positioned and oriented, this location matches the absolute coordinate system and the current location of the WCS.
Note:
It is required that the tool length is along the X-axis, and the width is in the Y-axis.
All used devices must follow the this orientaion rule.
For tool assemblies or devices that mount directly on a turret, the axes orientation and location of the tool mount junction must match the axes orientation and location of the tool mount junction defined on the turret in the machine model kinematics.


In the Specify Tool Tip row, click CSYS Dialog to define the tool tip junction, which is always be P9. This allows NX to calculate the correct tracking point automatically.

Independent of the specified tracking point P Number, which is defined on the tracking tab of the tool creation dialog box, select the center of the corner radius (P9) to define the origin of the tool tip junction. NX automatically moves the origin to the actual location of the first tracking point, which is P4 in this example. The XY plane of the tool tip junction defines the work plane of the tool, which coincides with the actual work plane on the machine when the tool is cutting.
Note:
Do not select the tracking point you define on the tracking tab of tool dialog box.
The export function automatically adjusts the tool tip position to the correct tracking point.
If you wish to check your exported tool tracking point, navigate to mach\resource\library\tool\graphics and verify the tool tip position inside the Machine Tool Builder.
If you created a temporary arc or circle to specify the tool tip, delete it now so it will not appear when the tool is retrieved from the library.
Under Cutting Portion of Tool, click Select Object and select the modeled tool insert, as shown.
Note:
All the additional components and solids are used as non-cutting elements.
In the Tracking Point dialog box, click No.
Click Export Tool To Library .
In the Select Target Class dialog box, specify the class for your tool, for example UG_TURNING_STD, and click OK.
NX does the following:
Creates a new tool entry with the specified Library Reference in the tool_database.dat file of the ASCII tool library.
Creates a copy of the current assembly part file in the mach\resource\library\tool\graphics folder. The name of the part file matches the name of the specified tool libref.
Read the information in the Export Tool to Library dialog box, and click OK.
Close the assembly part file.
The current work part is no longer needed to define the library tool. If you need it for other purposes, you can save it somewhere in your local working environment.
Caution:
Do not save the work part manually in the mach\resource\library\tool\graphics folder. NX automatically saved the part in the correct location when you exported the tool part file.
Test the tool assembly during simulation with an appropriate machine tool model to be sure that it is correct.
Caution:
The MRL or ASCII library data must match the graphics for the tool in the part file. For example, if the part file shows a topside tool, you must classify the tool as topside in the MRL or ASCII library.
You can import solid turning tool assemblies into a Teamcenter library."

You can apply the process described here to cutting tools and other non-cutting objects that you may want to display, such as retention knobs.
If you obtain solid models from the manufacturer, you may still have to move the body to the correct position and orientation.
Model the part of the tool holder that fits into the spindle of your machine tool, from the tool change flange to the hole for the retention knob.
Model the part so that the absolute coordinate system is at the spindle gauge point, and the part is oriented in the XY plane with the tool axis along X.
The sketch shown is dimensioned for the common dimensions of DIN2080 tool holders. The important dimensions, to the X– side of the CSYS, are the 31.5 radius and the 10 mm thickness of the flange.
Everything to the X+ side of the CSYS is for display only – it is inserted into the spindle and thus plays no part in collision checking.
For most standard taper tool holders, the taper is 3.5 units in 12, or 7 units in 24. You can model the taper angle very accurately by entering atangent(7/48) when you dimension the half-angle shown. The sketch will not show the formula; it will show 8.3 degrees.
Revolve the sketched section to create a body for the unchanging element of your machine’s tool holders.
Details such as holes and drive slots are acceptable, but they are not necessary.
Sketch the part of the holder or holder family that varies with each cutting tool.
Most manufacturers provide a table of the important dimensions.
Revolve and unite the varying part of the tool holder.
If you do not plan to create a family of tool holders, you can stop here.
If you have several holders that match the pattern of the sketch, create named dimensions with meaningful names, and edit the sketch to use these dimensions directly or in formulas.
In the Modeling application, choose Tools tab→Utilities group→Spreadsheet .
NX is locked from any interaction while the spreadsheet is open.
In Excel, on the Add-Ins tab, choose Extract Expr.
All of the expressions in the part are copied to the spreadsheet. You need only the data that matches values in the manufacturer’s chart.
Delete all rows except the ones that contain the named expressions that you created to match the holder manufacturer’s chart.
The spreadsheet should look something like this:
Fill in the values for your other holders in the family, so that each column beside the expression names contains the values for one possible configuration of the holder.
Your spreadsheet might look like this.
In Excel, on the Add-Ins tab, choose Options→NX Preferences.
Clear the Use Fixed Update Range check box, and click OK.
Select the rows and columns that contain expression names and possible sets of values, as shown.
On the Add-Ins tab, choose Define Expr Range.
This identifies a named range of spreadsheet cells that NX can use to update the part.
You can now test your model to see if the members of the family can be created without errors.
Arrange the spreadsheet so that you can see columns of values and the NX graphics window.
Select the cells that comprise any single column of values other than the currently modelled configuration.
On the Add-Ins tab, choose Update NX Part.
If there are no modelling or other issues, the part updates to the selected configuration.
Repeat the cell selection and update process to test all configurations.
In the spreadsheet, below each column of values, enter the full path and part name where you would like the family member saved.
For example, you could enter C:\temp\h9001, and so on. Do not worry about the display.
If the part names form a sequential numeric pattern, you can use auto-fill to populate the row.
When you complete the row of part names, select all cells containing expression names, values, and part names, as shown.

These junctions establish the relationship between the machine and the cutting tool that is needed to create programs.
In general, CAM programming systems assume that the tool tip is coplanar with the work plane of the lathe; however, manufacturers often add a rake angle to a tooling insert. The angle is chosen to be suitable for machining the material for which the cutter is intended.
CAM programming systems typically project the tool tip to the work plane, and in NX we do the same.
When you define a tracking point for a cutting tool whose face does not lie in the XY plane of the tooling assembly, you must project the tool tip radius, create an approximating arc, and use that arc to construct required tracking points.
If there is not already an XY datum plane in the tool assembly, create one.
Zoom in the view on the tool tip radius.
If the tool tip radius is an arc or an ellipse, create the center point.
Curve tab→Curve group→Point
Type = Arc/Ellipse/Sphere Center
Project the edge that corresponds to the tool tip radius, and the center point, to the XY datum plane.

Curves or Points to Project group→Select Curve or Point

Create a circle to approximate the tool tip.
If necessary, hide the tool body as you work.
It is usually acceptable to use the nominal tool tip radius if it is known. For example, if the radius appears to be 0.799 mm, you could round it to 0.8 mm, which is a common nominal radius.
Move the WCS to the center of the new circle and proceed to create a tracking point as described in Turning tool tips and tracking points and Create a solid turning tool assembly for export to a library.
Delete temporary curves, except the point at the tracking point location."

The tool library has an independent classification system and tool parameters. The tool classes and parameters are recognized when you export tools to the cutting tool library.
When you export a tool that you build in your CAM session to the library:
The tool is written into the tool_database.dat ASCII file that matches the units of your part.
If the cutting tool has a holder defined, NX saves a reference to the tool holder with the tool. The next time you retrieve this tool, the holder is retrieved with it. If the tool holder is new or modified, it is saved to the holder library.
You can save a meaningful description of your tool that is available each time you reload the tool.
You can set the initial number used to create the libref with the Starting Number for User Librefs customer default.
The first user tool library reference is either the Starting Number for User Librefs value, or one more than the highest library reference, whichever is greater.

The ASCII Data File is a list of records. The general structure of a record is:
record-type parameters
There are two record types which are referred to by the following keywords:
FORMAT
DATA
A FORMAT record describes the list of parameters ( DB_IDs) to be found in the subsequent DATA records and consists of the keyword FORMAT followed by a list of attribute identifiers. The attribute identifiers are used as DB_ID values within the DB_ALIAS structures of the Definition File (dbc_tool_ascii.def). You can define your own attribute identifiers which you need to describe your tools. The FORMAT line includes all the parameters which you wish to input for each data record in that class. For example:
FORMAT
 LIBRF
 T
UGT
UGST
ST

MATREF
MATDES
HLD

Note:
A hash sign (#) indicates a comment - everything after this sign to the end of the line is ignored.
Each DATA record contains the data for one tool in the database. A DATA record consists of the keyword DATA followed by a list of attribute values separated by '|'. The DATA record corresponding to the above FORMAT line might look like this:
DATA | ugt0201_001 |02| 01|01|01| End Mill |TMC0_00006|HSS-Co5-TiN | 320 | Steep Taper 20 | 10.5 | 35.3| 4| 55
In the data record:
There must be the same number of parameters as there are DB_IDs in the FORMAT line above (an empty parameter is permissible).
Each parameter must be separated by the pipe symbol ( | ). At the end of the record there is no pipe symbol.
The first non blank character after DATA must be a pipe symbol.
If a record does not start with either FORMAT or DATA, it is treated as continuation of the previous FORMAT or DATA record.
The following attributes are common to all tool types and subtypes:

Holding system for mounting tool to machine . HLD is used to check whether the tool can be mounted to a pocket of the tool carrier of the machine. The HLD value here has to match one of the holding systems specified in the pocket definition in the postprocessor .def file of the machine.
If you are using this attribute to mount a device to a device holder in a machine tool model, the HLD value has to match the holder system under which you classified the device holder in the Machine Tool Builder application.

Warning:
  The attributes LIBRF, T, ST are mandatory."

A class that is nested inside another class is called a subclass. In the tool database, the top-level class is the tool. In the device library, the top-level class is the device, and so on.
For example, in dbc_tool_ascii.def, the parent class is TOOL. The parent class and each subclass is defined with a CLASS statement. Within the TOOL class, the subclass MILLING is defined, and within the MILLING class, further subclasses are defined, such as END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE.
Each top-level subclass has a type that is identified by the T field. Each tool type has subtypes that are identified by the ST field.
Example:
Tool type:
Milling with T = 02
Subtypes:
End Mills Non-indexable with ST = 01
End Mills Indexable with ST = 02
Each type T must be mapped to a corresponding NX internal data type, UGT, and each subtype ST must be mapped to a corresponding NX internal data subtype, UGST.
Example:
The Milling tools class with T = 02 has a Chamfer Mills Non-indexable subclass with ST = 05. The tool class and subclass are mapped to the NX internal data type Mill by the settings:
UGT = 01
UGST = 05
Tools that belong to each subtype are grouped in the database by these statements:
#CLASS NAME_OF_CLASS

#END_DATA
The #CLASS statement is followed by a class name that is identified in the definition file for the library, for example, in dbc_tool_ascii.def file.
The next line after a #CLASS statement is the FORMAT statement, which lists all of the attributes for the class. The attributes are explained in comments at the beginning of the database, and are often referenced in Tcl code and other files by an alias which makes the code easier to read. A custom type must include at least the following attributes:
Common Aliases
Attribute
Alias
Description
LIBRF
Libref
A unique library reference that identifies the tool.
T
Type
Identifies the high level classification in the library, for example, milling, drilling, turning, or solid tools.
ST
SubType
Identifies the subtype of the class for the data, for example, barrel mills, spot drills, face grooving, or probing tools.
UGT
UG Tool Type
Maps your tool type to an NX internal type.
UGST
UG Tool SubType
Maps your tool subtype to an NX internal subtype.
Note:
To see what types and subtypes are used in the other libraries, open their respective database.dat files in a text editor. The types and subtypes are explained in comments at the beginning of the file.
If you require an expanded hierarchy, you must determine the requirements for enhancing this classification. The table shows how some common tool library types and subtypes are classified.

First Step
> 1. Back up the library files"

${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource\library\tool\english\tool_database.dat
${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource\library\tool\metric\tool_database.dat
${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource\library\tool\ascii\dbc_tool_ascii.def

${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource\library\tool\ascii\dbc_tool_ascii_export.tcl
${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource\ug_library\dbc_tool_general.tcl
Next Step
> 2. Add MY_END_MILLS tools to the database"
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/cust_lib_add_classes_ex_ht1,2. Add MY_END_MILLS tools to the database,"In the ${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource\library\tool\english folder, open the file tool_database.dat.
In the comments at the beginning of the file, check the ST column for available subtypes.
#    T   Lib Type    ST  Lib Subtype                         UGT  UG Type        UGST  UG Subtype
For this example, because 75 is not used as a subtype for end mills, you will assign it to your new class.
Add your new class to the table to document it.
#    02  Milling     75  My End Mills          01   Mill         01    5 Parameter
In the # Milling Tools area, add these lines:
#CLASS MY_END_MILLS
#END_DATA
Note:
The #CLASS and #END_DATA statements are parsed by Tcl code. Do not include extra space characters, particularly at the end of the statement where you may not notice them.
Copy the FORMAT statement from the non-indexable end mill class, #CLASS END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE, and paste it between the new class identifier #CLASS MY_END_MILLS and the end of data statement, #END_DATA so the result is similar to this:
#CLASS MY_END_MILLS
FORMAT LIBRF T ST UGT UGST DESCR MATREF MATDES TLNUM ADJREG CUTCOMREG HLD HLDDES DIA FN HEI ZOFF DROT FLEN TAPA TIPA COR1 CTH HOFF ZMOUNT RIGID TSDIA TSLEN TSTLEN RAMPANGLE HELICALDIA MINRAMPLEN MAXCUTWIDTH HLDREF TPREF
#END_DATA
Because the FORMAT statement may change in any new release, you should copy a FORMAT statement from the tool type on which you are basing your new class. in this example, the new class is based on #CLASS END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE.
You are not going to copy or modify a tool record. The preferred practice is to export tools from NX. This assures that the data is correctly formatted.
Tip:
To help you to identify the data fields if debugging is needed, you can include comment lines to show field separators adjacent to fields in the format statement, as shown in this partial line.
FORMAT LIBRF T ST UGT UGST DESCR
#-—-—-—|--—-—|-|-—|-—-|-—-—|
You can use extra spaces in the FORMAT and DATA statements to align data fields with keywords, as shown here:
FORMAT LIBRF           T    ST   UGT  UGST
#------+----------–--–-+----+----+----+----
DATA   | ugti0000_1001 | 02 | 75 | 01 | 1  
The database record is now set up for you to create and export a new tool of this class from within NX.
Save the file.

        DIALOG 
        RSET 
        UI_NAME ""My End Mills""
      }
The attribute aliases in the DIALOG line determine the attribute input in the Search Criteria dialog box.
The attribute aliases in the RSET line determine the attribute input in the Search Result dialog box.
Copy the content of the DIALOG and RSET lines from CLASS END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE, the class on which you are basing your new class.
This assures that the proper parameters are available to the users. The content may differ from release to release.
Save the file.

The ASC_build_end_mill procedure includes such a check. You must add your subclass to the checking code.
In the ${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource\library\tool\ascii\ folder, open the file dbc_tool_build_ascii.tcl.
Find the line that contains this comment:
# Output tip angle for end mill
In the next line, you must provide for the possibility that an end mill has your new subtype, 75. You will insert a logical or condition.
Change the next line that checks end mill subtypes to determine whether to add a tip angle. Change it from this:
if {$asc_lib_subtype == 1 || $asc_lib_subtype == 2} {
to this:
if {$asc_lib_subtype == 1 || $asc_lib_subtype == 2 || $asc_lib_subtype == 75} {
Find the line that contains this comment:

Add the line that contains MY_END_MILLS.
Change it from this:
if { ($asc_lib_subtype == 1 && $dbc_class == ""END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE"") ||
($asc_lib_subtype == 2 && $dbc_class == ""END_MILL_INDEXABLE"") ||
($asc_lib_subtype == 3 && $dbc_class == ""BALL_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE"")} \

DB_ALIAS defines the text string that is used in Tcl procedures and elsewhere in the dbc_tool_ascii.def file to refer to the attribute.
DB_ID defines the attribute’s column title that is used in the FORMAT statement in the database.dat files.
DIALOG_NAME defines the caption that appears in the Search Criteria dialog box.

Notice that the subtype value 76 is going to be used for the new class.
Add the attributes for the Search Criteria dialog box in the DIALOG line by copying the DIALOG attributes from the class END_MILL_NON_INDEXABLE.
In the DIALOG line for COMPANY_END_MILLS, insert the alias for the new attribute, companyid, after the alias libref:

Change the next line that checks end mill subtypes to determine whether to add a tip angle. Change it from this:
if {$asc_lib_subtype == 1 || $asc_lib_subtype == 2} {
to this:
if {$asc_lib_subtype == 1 || $asc_lib_subtype == 2 || $asc_lib_subtype == 76} {

You should test the class by exporting a tool and retrieving it.
If errors occur, refer to the TCL_ERROR feedback in your log file.
In NX, edit a tool that does not belong to a library. If necessary, create a new tool.
To determine whether a tool belongs to a library, in the editing dialog box, on the Tool tab, in the Library group, verify that the Library Reference box contains no text.
If the tool belongs to a library, the value of the libref field for the tool in the database is shown.
Click Export Tool to Library .
In the Select Target Class dialog box, select COMPANY_END_MILLS, and click OK.
In the Template Attributes dialog box, in the Attributes to Assign group, in the Company ID box, type a value. For example, you could enter ACME-123.
Click OK.
If the tool is successfully exported, the Export Tool to Library message box display the tool number that was assigned, and the library to which the tool was exported.
In the Export Tool to Library message box, click OK.
In the tool editing dialog box, click Cancel.
Choose Home tab→Insert group→Create Tool .
In the Create Tool dialog box, in the Library group, click Retrieve Tool from Library .
In the Library Class Selection dialog box, under the Milling node, select Company End Mills and click OK.
In the Search Criteria dialog box, click Count Matches .
There should be only one match, the tool you just exported as a test.
Click OK.
In the Search Result dialog box, in the Matching Items list, your newly exported tool should appear. The tool should have ugti0275_xxxx in the Libref column, where xxxx is the next available tool number for user library references. There should be a Company ID column, and it should contain the value you typed earlier.

https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid925021,Using custom parameters on library tools,"The tool library can contain more parameters than are used in the NX tool definition. When you retrieve a tool in NX, the relevant parameters are mapped to the tool object in the part file. Postprocessors and shop documentation can directly read all parameters in the database. Database parameters are visible in NX only if they are assigned a location in the dialog box in the dialog box template file. You can customize NX to add additional parameters to a tool that you retrieve from the tool library. You can define these additional parameters either in Tcl code or as fields in the tool database.
Flow of parameters from database to end user
An NX postprocessor and shop documentation can read tool parameters directly from the tool database.
When you add custom parameters to a class, the postprocessor and the shop documentation can query their values.
NX maps tool parameters form the database to tool objects. The tool dialog box provides user access to the parameters. NX transfers these values to the postprocessor and to shop documentation as MOM variables.
If your custom parameters are things like a text string that describes the plant where a tool is available, or the tool crib within a plant where the tool is stored, you could transfer it directly to the machinist in the form of postprocessor-created comments or shop documentation.
If you want the NX CAM programmer to see and edit these custom tool parameters, you need to add them to the tool dialog box. With custom parameters in the dialog box, instead of the flow of information being directly from the library to the post, it goes through the NX CAM programmer.
Note:
It is not necessary to customize your tool library database to provide parameters that do not have a varying value. You can do that entirely within Tcl by following the example provided.
The chart shows the flow of parameters between the tool library, the template part that determines the user interface, the NX CAM tool, and postprocessor or shop documentation.
To add user parameters that do not exist in the library, you must:
Create a program called dbc_tool_ud_data.tcl in the folder that is identified by the UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TOOL_ASCII_DIR environment variable.
In the program, define the parameters, including the user interface, variable names, data types, default values, and user interface labels.
A sample Tcl file is provided, dbc_tool_ud_data_sample.tcl. When you retrieve a library tool, this program creates one new user parameter of each type. It includes two examples of how to provide an existing tool parameter for user modification."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid925068,Create user-defined tool parameters,"This example describes how to create custom user-defined parameters for library tools.
In the folder described by the environment variable UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TOOL_ASCII_DIR, copy and rename the file dbc_tool_ud_data_sample.tcl to dbc_tool_ud_data.tcl.
The program that handles tool parameters, dbc_tool_ascii.tcl, contains code that sources this file if it exists.
Test the action of the sample program before you make modifications.
In a new NX session, retrieve a tool from the tool library.
Note:
Custom user-defined tool parameters apply only to library tools.
In the Machine Tool view of the Operation Navigator, right-click the tool that you retrieved and choose Information.
The bottom of the listing should contain the following lines:
User Tool Parameters
 Sample Integer = -1
 Sample Double = -1.000000
 Sample Toggle (Boolean) = True
 Sample Text (String) = default text
 Sample Option List = Yes
Depending on the type of tool that you retrieve, it may also contain lines similar to the following:
 Taper Angle (Library TAPA) = 0.000000
 Tip Angle (Library TIPA) = 0.000000
In a plain text editor, open dbc_tool_ud_data.tcl and examine the program for the following procedures.
Note:
A plain text editor is one that does not add hidden formatting characters to the file. A few examples of plain text editors are Notepad, Notepad++, and TextPad.
The program begins with a number of utility procedures. There is no reason to change any of these.
Notice the common structure that is used for parameters: name, type, value, and label become elements in a row of the parameter array.
proc SetParameter { name pType value label } is called for integers (pType=""i""), decimal number or double numbers (pType=""d""), Boolean values (pType=""b""), and text strings (pType=""s"").
proc SetOptionParameter { name value values label } is called for the more complexly structured option lists (pType=""o""). Here, value is the default value that appears in the list, and values is an array of possible values. The type parameter is not needed; in Tcl, everything is a string, so it does not matter.
The next procedure, AskAttVal { attId dbRow outputFormat defaultValue flagRef }, gets the value of a parameter from a row in the database and returns a flag indicating failure or degrees of success.
The procedure FindEntry {} gets a row of data from the database.
The procedure DBC_ud_data {} is the area that you can customize.
In the body of the DBC_ud_data procedure, after the variable declarations and the initialization of a variable that tracks the number of parameters, set dbc_ud_num_parameters 0, remove or comment out lines for parameter types that you are not going to use.
Add rows or modify the sample rows for data types that you require.
For data types “i”, “d”, “b”, and “s”, new data is created by a simple procedure call of the format:
SetParameter ""parameter name"" ""type"" numeric_value ""Label""
or
SetParameter ""parameter name"" ""type"" ""boolean or string value"" ""Label""
For the option list, you must set values and value before you call SetOptionParameter. Notice that the method used to set the default value value is the statement set value [lindex $values 0]. The second argument to lindex is a reference to the zero-based index of the default choice, within the array of possible values choices. For the example list with the values { ""Yes"" ""No"" ""Maybe"" }, valid values for the second argument of the lindex command are 0, 1, and 2. If you used 3, you would get an error message because the array reference would be out of bounds.
Save the program, and, in a new NX session, retrieve a tool from the tool library to test your changes.
If you want to read fields from the tool database and define those as user defined parameters, follow the example at the end of the procedure; otherwise, you can safely delete or comment out this section of code.
The example uses specific parameters TAPA and TIPA if they apply to the tool that is retrieved. It uses the return value of the AskAttVal procedure to determine whether or not to create a parameter.
Save the program, and, in a new NX session, retrieve a tool from the tool library to test your changes.
This procedure adds user parameters to library tools as they are retrieved and makes them available to the postprocessor and to shop documentation.

This example describes the process of adding parameters to all mill tools in the metric library. The procedure for the English unit library is identical, except for the location of the template file. The procedure to add parameters to other tool types is the same.
In NX, navigate to your UGII_CAM_TEMPLATE_PART_METRIC_DIR and open library_dialogs.prt.
In the Machine Tool view of the Operation Navigator, scroll down to the MILL tool.
Generally, scroll to the template for the first type of tool to which you are going to add parameters.
Right-click the node and choose Object→Customize.
In the Customize Dialog dialog box, in the Items Used list, expand the tab page on which you want the user parameters to appear.
Select the group to which you want to add the user parameters as a subgroup.
For this example, select the Dimensions group under Tab Page: Tool.
You can also make the user parameters a separate group. You will come to that step in a moment.
In the Items to Add group, from the Dialog Item Type list, select Customizable Items.
From the Items to Add list, select User Parameters.
If the option is not available, it has already been added somewhere in the dialog box.
Click Add to Dialog .
The Items Used list should resemble this:

These attributes appear in the tool dialog boxes in the Manufacturing application. You can add attributes, but you cannot leave any of the mandatory attributes out.
The mandatory attributes depend on the NX internal type/subtype (class/subclass) to which the library type/subtype has been mapped. If you add a new tool type to the tool_database.dat file, you must map your new type/subtype to a Manufacturing type/subtype."

These processors recognize a limited number of tool classes and subclasses. Those recognized are found in dbc_tool_general.tcl. When you set up a class hierarchy in the Library, it is essential that you map any class you use or create to one of these internal Manufacturing tool classes. The standard Library installation performs the mapping shown below. In an ASCII database, the system uses the UGT and UGST attributes. In Teamcenter, you perform the mapping by using the pull-down menu in attribute number -5110, UG tool type.

Legacy tool types are for tools converted from old part file tool libraries.

Tip:
Use this table when you are filling your database as a quick reference for type and subtype.
If you introduce new Library types and subtypes (T, ST), you also have to specify the corresponding internal NX types and subtypes (UGT, UGST) in order to map your new library type to an NX-internal one.  If you don't specify NX types and subtypes, the default mapping shown above will occur."

** MRL internal attribute
*** MRL attribute has multiple values.
How the Manufacturing Resource Library maps attributes
The tables for mandatory parameter show how Manufacturing Resource Library (MRL) attributes are mapped to attributes in NX Manufacturing. If multiple MRL attributes can map to a single NX attribute, the tables indicate the mapping precedence.
In the following example, the Manufacturing Resource Library maps the cutter length, dbc_cutter_height(0) to the MRL attributes in the following order of precedence.
-45260 DCL Cutting Diameter Length if it exists.
-45002 Nomin. Setup X if it exists.
If the MRL Default Value column lists the attribute as Mandatory, the attribute does not have a default value. You must enter the value in Teamcenter.

Here is a list of the mandatory parameters for a step drill. The data for these attributes must be contained in the .dat file. If you would like to include any of these attributes as search criteria, then they must also be defined as a DB_ALIAS in the .def file.
The step drill parameters used by NX and the NX Library vary. You must input the parameters shown below. The system then uses these parameters to calculate those parameters required by NX.
Note:
If an attribute is Mandatory, it does not have a default value. You must enter the value in Teamcenter.
* These parameters do not appear in the dialog but the DBC variable must be set.
Drill step parameter values are stored in the segmented_tool_database.dat file.

It sets the speed, feeds, depth of cut, and stepover values based on the current cutting conditions. The Machining Data library improves on the Feeds and Speeds library (which only sets the speed and feed values) for milling. To efficiently cut similar parts, determine the optimum parameter settings for your cutting conditions, and add them to the Machining Data Library. Any user can then apply these settings to his/her operations. The library uses three primary inputs from the operation: Tool Material, Part Material, and Cut Method. The secondary inputs are Tool Diameter and Tool Length.
Note:
Machining Data libraries are typically set up by a site administrator. You must have write access to the library files to edit them.
Turning operations do not use the Machining Data libraries. Turning operations use the Feeds and Speeds library.
What Parameters are Stored
The Machining Data library stores the parameters listed in the following tables.
Parameters Input from the Operation and Matched to Library Records
Primary Filters (exact match)
Secondary Filters
Tool Material
Cut Method
Part Material
Tool Diameter
Tool Length
In the operation, the tool material, diameter, and length are inherited from the Tool parent, the Cut method is inherited from the Method parent, and the Part material is inherited from the geometry parent or the setup. All three of these parents must have valid library entries for you to use the machining data system to set the operation's cutting parameters. Please see Accessing the Cut Method Library for more information on setting the Cut method, Part Material, and Tool material.

* Cut depth and stepover values are optional for individual machining data records.
To set the values, select the Cut Depth or Stepover check boxes.
If you do not set the values, NX saves the machining record with a -1 entry in the Cut Depth and Stepover columns. The -1 tells NX not to set a value.
Standard Machining Data Library data
The Machining Data library contains fully defined high speed machining (HSM) operation data for combinations of the following:
Tool Material
HSM Carbide Ball Mill, Solid, TiAlN Coated (Libref: TMC0_00021)
HSM Carbide End Mill, Solid, TiAlN Coated, < 5% corner (Libref: TMC0_00022)

Tool Diameter ranging from 1 mm  (0.0394 in)  to 25 mm (0.9449 in)
Tool Length ranging from 3 mm (0.1181in)  to 168 mm (6.6142 in)
Note:
Not all combinations of tools and part material are available.
Use the End Mill tool type for tools with corner radii that is less than 5% of the tool diameter.
Use the Bull Nose tool type for tools with corner radii ranging from 5% to 20% of the tool diameter.
Only use the End Mill tool type (with no corner radii) for wall and floor finishing. Set the type to Bull Nose for regular roughing.
Tool length/diameter ratios of 3 and 5 are supported. Machine data for all other length/diameter ratios are interpolated.
References to Other Libraries
The Machining Data Library references entries within other manufacturing libraries. These libraries are shared with the feeds and speeds system, so changes to these tables may affect both feeds and speeds and machining data calculations. Modifying or deleting an entry within the Machining Data Library doesn't affect the referenced entry in any other library. The Machining Data Library references the following libraries (tables):
Part Material
Tool Material
Cut Method
Cutting Tools
Machine Tools (Machines)
In addition, if you have used the feeds and speeds system to store machining data, you can import data from the Feeds and Speeds library into the Machining Data library.

Each of these information types is stored in a separate library.
The Feeds and Speeds library contains records of surface speed and feed per tooth recommendations. Each of these records is based on a part material tool material, cut method and depth of cut.
Note:
The Feeds and Speeds library is provided for legacy operations and turning operations. The Machining Data library replaces the Feeds and Speeds library for milling, provides more functionality, and should be used for new work. See The Machining Data Library for more information.
Note:
Automatic feed and speed calculation is not supported for user defined milling tools.
Reset from Table
You can access the Feeds and Speeds Library by using the Reset from Table button in the feed rates dialog. When you select this button for an operation the following takes place.
The system reads the part material from the geometry parent.
The system reads the tool material from the tool parent.
The system reads the cut method from the method parent.
The system reads the depth of cut from the operation.
The system sends these four values to the Feeds and Speeds Library.
NX Library searches the Feeds and Speeds Library for a matching record.
The library returns recommendations for surface speed and feed per tooth.
The feed rates dialog calculates the spindle speed and various feed rates based on the processor you are in. Each processor determines which feed rates are calculated. Some feed rate values are set as percentages of cut feed rate. This relationship is defined in the event handler. You can also manually enter the other feed rate values. See the documentation for the feed rates dialog in each processor.
Note:
You can only use the Reset from Table option if you have already set the cut method, tool material and part material.
Note:
Once you have used Reset from Table, the feed rates that are calculated using the Feeds and Speeds library are no longer inherited from the method parent.
There are two ways to access the feed rates dialog:
From the operation dialog box.
In the Operation Navigator, right-click the operation and choose Object→Feed Rates
Note:
If you select multiple operations, NX uses the calculation for the first operation for all the selected operations. For operations that use different tools, part materials, or cut methods, select each operation individually.
For more information on the feed rates dialog see the feed rates section in the Object-Start Post, End Post, feed rates section.
Accessing the Cut Method Library
Set the cut method in the Cut Method Dialog. This dialog may be reached in the following ways:
In the Operation Navigator method view, at the location where you want to access the Cut Method Library, choose Insert→Method.
Choose Menu→Insert→Method.

Double-click on an existing tool in the tool view of the Operation Navigator.
In the Operation Navigator tool view, right-click where you want to access the Tool Material Library, and choose Insert→Tool.
Use the Create Tool icon .
then
Select the Material button to open the Search Result Dialog for the Tool Material Library.
Select the desired tool material from the Tool Material Library.
Accessing the Part Material Library
You can set the part material either from the setup, or in a Workpiece or Mill_Geom geometry group . If you have not selected the part material in the geometry group, the group inherits the material from its geometry parent or the setup. The material in the setup is the default material for geometry groups.
To set the part material in the setup, choose Menu→Tools→ Part Material and select the desired part material from the Part Material Library.
To set the part material at the geometry group level go to the Workpiece or Mill_Geom Dialog. This dialog may be reached in three ways:
Double-click on an existing workpiece in the geometry view of the Operation Navigator.
In the Operation Navigator geometry view, right-click where you want to access the Part Material Library, and choose Insert→Geometry.
Use the Create Geometry Icon and select Workpiece or Mill_Geom.

For an operation to retrieve data from the library, its Tool Material, Cut Method, and Part Material (the primary filters) must exactly match entries in the library. Once these are matched, the system looks for matches to Tool Diameter and Tool Length (the secondary filters).
Tool Length (L) includes tool length and shank length without the holder offset.
Tool Length （L) = Tool Length + Shank Length - Holder Offset (OS)
The library returns parameter values as follows:
Is there a close match for Tool Diameter (D) and Tool Length (L)?
Yes: Assign the stored parameter values to the operation.
If not, is there a close match for Tool Diameter, and the operation's Tool Length value is between two library record Tool Length values?
Yes: Interpolate between the two Tool Length records.
If not, is there a close match for Tool Length, and the operation's Tool Diameter value is between two library record Tool Diameter values?
Yes: Interpolate between the two Tool Diameter records.
If not, is the operation's tool deflection (based on the tool diameter and length) between two records that have a similar deflection?
Yes: Interpolate between the two records.
If the system is unable to find two records with similar deflection to interpolate between, the system returns the machining data for the closest similar record without interpolating.
Interpolating Parameter Values
When an operation's Tool Diameter and Tool Length values do not exactly match library records, the software interpolates between records before assigning parameters values to the operation. The system searches for tools that have a similar deflection.
Sample Interpolation 1
Tool Material = TMC0_00021, HSM Carbide Ball Mill
Cut Method = OPD0_00021, HSM ROUGH MILLING
Part Material = MAT0_00464, P20 Mold Steel
Operation tool diameter = .1575 in
Operation tool length = .7500 in
There is an exact match for tool diameter and the operation's tool length falls between two records. The system would interpolate the output parameter values to be between the two records as follows:

Configuration
A system administrator with Teamcenter administrator privileges must configure the connection between native NX and four-tier Teamcenter services.
On the Teamcenter server, from the Teamcenter installation disk, from the advanced_installations\resource_management folder, run the setup.exe program to install the MRL in your database. Refer to the Teamcenter documentation, in the chapter Install the Manufacturing Resource Library, for details.
On a computer with NX installed, again run the MRL setup.exe program, and select the Configure NX Library option.
The following files are added into a specified MACH structure:
...mach\resource\library\tool\inclass\dbc_mrl_tooling_library_tlas.tcl
...mach\resource\library\tool\inclass\dbc_mrl_tooling_library_tlas_en.def
...mach\resource\library\tool\inclass\dbc_mrl_tooling_library_tlas_de.def
After the installation, copy the added files to every instance of MACH or RESOURCE that NX users will be using when they access the MRL.
The .def files which control the user interface to the MRL are currently available for English (en) and German (de).
On each computer that has an NX environment, define the following environment variables to suit your database:
FMS_HOME
The path of the local tccs directory.
JAVA_HOME
The path the folder where Java is installed. For example C:\apps\Java\jre7x64. To find the required Java version information you can either check the Siemens Digital Industries Software Certification Database or use the command java -version in a Teamcenter command prompt on the Teamcenter server.
UGII_UGMGR_COMMUNICATION
Currently, HTTP is the only supported value.
UGII_UGMGR_HTTP_URL
The URL to access four-tier services on Teamcenter. The system administrator who installs Teamcenter assigns this value. For MRL connect, the URL is appended with /aiws/webservice. You can find the administrator’s original setting in your configuration folder, %TC_ROOT%\portal\plugins\configuration_***, where the *** varies with the installed version of Teamcenter. Look for the file client_specific.properties, and find DEFAULT_SERVER.URI.
For example, if DEFAULT_SERVER.URI=http://server:7001/tc, then UGII_UGMGR_HTTP_URL has the value http://server:7001/tc/aiws/aiwebservice.
Make certain that four tier services are started and available to the NX users on your network.
When users retrieve a tool from the MRL for the first time in a session, they must log in to Teamcenter.
Learn more about managing your tooling library in the chapter Resource Manager Guide in the Teamcenter documentation. Search for MRL Connect for NX configuration."

xxx_database.dat represents tool_database.dat.
When you convert the tool_database.dat, holder_database.dat, segmented_tool_databse.dat, and trackpoint_database.dat are converted automatically.
Caution:
Before you convert a library, make a backup copy of the destination library that you are going to update. The files are located in the folders identified by the variables UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TOOL_ENGLISH_DIR and UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TOOL_METRIC_DIR.
The conversion program:
Converts all new and uniquely identified tools within the specified xxx_database.dat file and adds them to the xxx_database.dat file for the current release.
Creates a file with the name xxx_database.dat_converted in the same folder as the input library. For example, tool_database.dat becomes tool_database.dat_converted. The xxx_database.dat_converted file contains any records or entries that were not converted.
Merges any defined holders into the current holder library holder_database.dat file, unless the holder already matches an existing holder.
NX outputs the appropriate tool holder LIBRF field with the converted tool record. LIBRF is the data field for the unique library reference with the alias libref.
Appends data fields that were added to a library class in the <input_file_name>.dat file at the end of the records in the current tool_database.dat file, and applies a default value.
Removes custom data fields from a custom library class, if you remove the field from the FORMAT statement in the newer database.
Skips any tool in the xxx_databse.dat file that matches the LIBRF value of a tool in the current xxx_database.dat file.
Caution:
To retain changes to the default tools, you must assign a unique library reference to each modified tool before you do the conversion.

Database
Refers to the ASCII databases in the standard NX installation, and the Teamcenter engineering process management CAM databases that use can configure in the Manufacturing Resource Library (MRL) using the Resource Manager.
DB_ALIAS name
This stands for database alias. Each attribute in the database has a unique name. In NX Library, these attributes are assigned an alias and referred to as a DB_ALIAS. This alias must also be unique. You can only search for a database attribute that has been assigned a DB_ALIAS in the .def file. It is the DB_ALIAS name that is referred to in the type hierarchy section of the .def file to indicate which attributes are to be included in the Search Criteria dialog.
libref
This is the DB_ALIAS of the library reference. It is mandatory that this DB_ALIAS appears in the alias list.
Type
Subtype
Descr
These three DB_ALIASes are most commonly found and should therefore be contained in the list of DB_ALIASes. Type refers to the type of the object in the database, Subtype refers to the subtype of the object and Descr is the description of the object in the database.
DB_ID name
Name is the identifier which the Library uses to identify the attribute which corresponds to the name of the DB_ALIAS. This is the identifier found in the FORMAT line of the .dat file.
DB_ID_TYPE d/i/s
Type of identifier - the choices here are:
d - double
i - integer
s - string
OPTIONS ""opt1"" ""opt2"" ...""optn""

Edit Operation
Link RCS to MCS
Establishes the Reference Coordinate System (RCS) at the same location and orientation as the MCS.
NX stores every parameter set with a copy of the RCS that was active at the time it was created. During subsequent operations, you can retrieve these parameters and reposition them to the current (moved) RCS.
The default RCS is the Absolute Coordinate System.
Note:
The Link MCS/RCS preference affects how Link RCS to MCS is set in the MCS dialog box when you create a new MCS group.
If the preference is cleared, the software uses the setting from the MCS template.
If the preference is selected, the software overrides the MCS template and the Link RCS to MCS option is also selected by default.
When you retrieve parameters and relocate to the currently active RCS, the following parameters are mapped:
Clearance Planes
Part Surface (in milling modules)
Engage/Retract points/vectors/planes
Start and Return Points
Tool Axis
Projection Vector
Lower Limit Plane
Points and Tool Axis vectors associated with Post Commands.
The FROM and GOHOME locations are not mapped.
Note:
If you retrieve the description of an existing operation containing a reference to a tool which has been deleted, that tool reference is no longer valid, and the system displays an error message.
Relocate Parameters
Relocates the parameters associated with the operation to the currently active RCS. The parameters are mapped to the new Reference Coordinate System (RCS). If Reference Coordinate System, Use status is set to Stored, the Relocate Parameters option is not available.
Note:
The Relocate Parameter only effects the creation of new operations.
Note:
The From and Go Home points maintain their original positions even if Relocate Parameters is set to YES.

Features
Maximum Merge Factor
Controls when NX creates a single merged step hole or step pocket feature, and when NX creates multiple features. The merge factor applies both when you use the Find Features command to automatically select geometry, and when you manually select faces for a hole making operation.
NX uses the following formula to determine the maximum distance between the faces of a single feature.
Maximum Merge Factor * [feature diameter]

This reduces the processing time for operations. You specify the tolerance and the tool axis required to calculate the triangular facets, and NX creates faceted representations of the selected faces, solid bodies or sheet bodies. You can preprocess geometry directly in the part that contains the geometry, or in an assembly with components that contain the geometry. Whenever possible, NX uses the preprocessed geometry to generate tool paths and gouge check. When you preprocess geometry:
The geometry type must match the geometry specified in the operation. For example, if you preprocessed a solid body, select the solid body for the operation geometry. If you preprocess a solid body and then select faces in the operation, NX does not associate the selected faces with the preprocessed solid body.
The tool axis must match the tool axis specified in the operation.
You must update the preprocessed geometry any time you change the triangulation tolerance, tool axis, or modify the geometry that was preprocessed.
You should delete the preprocessed facet bodies when they are no longer needed to reduce the size of the part file and save memory space. The part file may still contain some facet bodies if they are required for assembly lightweight representations.
If you do not preprocess geometry, or the preprocessed geometry is not usable, NX processes the geometry the first time you generate the operation. The preprocessed geometry is not usable if:
It is out of date.

Existing facet body
Tolerance = 0.626301

Example 2
There are existing facet bodies with a tolerance of 0.626301. You delete the existing facet bodies and preprocess the part to create facet bodies with a Triangle Tolerance value of 0.1. This creates preprocessed facet bodies with a tolerance that is greater than the operation tolerance.
Existing facet body
Tolerance = 0.626301
Preprocessed facet body
Triangle Tolerance = 0.1
When you generate the tool path, NX deletes the preprocessed facet bodies because the operation cannot use them. NX then creates temporary facet bodies within the 0.05 operation tolerance so that it can machine the part at the required accuracy.

To find a customer default, choose File tab→Utilities→Customer Defaults, and click Find Default .
Select Object
Lets you select the geometry to create as a facet body. You can select faces, solid bodies, or sheet bodies. Use the Type Filter list on the Top border bar to limit your selections.
Triangle Tolerance
Specifies the tolerance used to create the facet body.
With a smaller number, NX creates more triangular facets to more smoothly represent contoured surfaces. More triangular facets require more processing time.
NX uses the facet body in an operation only if the Triangle Tolerance value is less than or equal to the operation tolerance. The operation tolerance is (Intol+Outtol)/2.
If you specify the smallest Triangle Tolerance value necessary to finish the part, all roughing and finishing operations can use the preprocessed facet body.
Triangle Tolerance = .02
Triangle Tolerance = .20
Specify Tool Axis
Specifies the fixed tool axis used to create the facet body.
NX uses the facet body in an operation only if this tool axis matches the tool axis specified in the operation.
Faceted representations list
Displays all facet bodies in the part file, including any assembly lightweight representations.
Information
Displays additional information, such as maximum facet size, in a separate window.
Update Facets
You must update the facets any time you change the Triangle Tolerance value or the tool axis. If you do not update, NX discards the change when you click OK or Apply.
Reset to Default
Sets the tolerance of the selected item in the faceted representations list to the Triangle Tolerance value specified in the Defaults for New Representations group.
Defaults for New Representations
Triangle Tolerance
Specifies the default tolerance used to create the facet body.
Tip:
You can use the Triangular Tolerance customer default to specify this value.
Specify Tool Axis
Specifies the default fixed tool axis used to create the facet body.
Faceting for Simulation
Specifies the components for which to create faceted bodies.
Create Part Facets
For each component in the Machine Tool Navigator – Setup Configurator with the _PART classification, creates a faceted body using the Gouge Tolerance value defined in the Gouge Tolerance customer default.
NX uses the part facets for gouge checking.
Create Blank Facets
For each component in the Machine Tool Navigator – Setup Configurator with the _WORKPIECE classification, creates a faceted body using the Chordal Tolerance value defined in the Manufacturing Preferences dialog box.
Tip:
To set the chordal tolerance, choose Manufacturing Preferences→Geometry→In Process Workpiece Tolerances→Chordal Tolerance.
NX uses the blank facets for collision checking.
Create Machine Component Facets
For each component in the Machine Tool Navigator – Setup Configurator that does not have a _PART or _WORKPIECE classification, creates a faceted body using the value defined in the Faceting Tolerance for Collision Detection customer default.
NX uses the machine component facets for running the simulation."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid601563,Facet bodies in Manufacturing,"When you generate an operation, NX sometimes uses a faceted representation of part bodies to calculate the tool path. You can preprocess these part bodies using the Faceting command. NX creates facet bodies at the specified Triangle Tolerance and stores them in the part file for the operation to use later. Most users specify the smallest tolerance value required for finishing the part.
During tool path generation, NX identifies any preprocessed facet bodies in the part file.
If the Triangle Tolerance value is less than or equal to the operation tolerance, NX uses the preprocessed facet bodies and continues to store them in the part file.
If the Triangle Tolerance value is greater than the operation tolerance, NX deletes the preprocessed facet bodies and creates new facet bodies at the operation tolerance. The new facet bodies are available for subsequent operations to use in the same session, but are not stored in the part.
Tip:
To find the operation tolerance settings, enter Tolerance in the operation's Find box.
Saving the part
When you save your part file, NX does the following:
Checks the assembly customer default settings for lightweight representations.
Deletes any temporary facet bodies created during tool path generation.
Saves any preprocessed facet bodies that are stored in the part file.
Creates the missing facet bodies that Assemblies requires for lightweight representations.
The lightweight representations requirements are set by the Automatic Lightweight Generation for customer default.
Tip:
To find a customer default, choose File tab→Utilities→Customer Defaults, and click Find Default .
The Faceted Representations list in the Cam Faceting dialog box displays all facet bodies in the part file, including the assembly lightweight representations."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/cust_cam,CAM Customization,"CAM allows you to completely define the manufacturing environment in which you will program. NX is delivered with a manufacturing environment already defined. The advantage of the NX system compared to other systems is that the description of the environment has been greatly expanded and you have the ability to customize this environment completely in order to enhance your productivity.
Our recommendation is to copy the ${UGII_BASE_DIR}\MACH\resource folder and set the variable UGII_CAM_RESOURCE_DIR to point to your copy. Do all of your customization in your copy of the resource folder structure.
Note:
When you set the environment variable for UGII_CAM_RESOURCE_DIR, you must add a backslash (\) to the end of the path to make it complete and comprehensive.
Example:
The following types of data that can be customized:
Manufacturing Templates
Definitions of Output formats.
Definitions of libraries and library data.
Process Assistants
A CAM environment exists from the time you first enter the Manufacturing module to the time you exit NX. The data in the environment is part file independent, which means it stays the same even if multiple parts are being used. This is logical because the same environment manufactures several parts.
This section describes each component of the machining environment and the benefits of customization. Later sections describe how the system is initially delivered and how to accomplish desired customization. Further details about each component may be found throughout the documentation.
Intent of the Customizing Tools
The Manufacturing environment consists of the following:
Manufacturing Templates
Operation templates
Method templates
Tool Templates
Geometry Templates
Setup templates
Output Control
Available CLSF formats
Tool-path listing format
Available Postprocessor templates
Available Shop Floor Documentation Templates
User defined events
NX Library
Machine Tool Library
Tool Library
Part Material Library
Tool Material Library
Cut methods
Feed and Speed Database
Process Assistants
Manufacturing Templates
The manufacturing templates are containers of procedures and option settings. They allow you to use the CAM system from different perspectives. You can use these templates to customize the workflow presented by NX and to customize the default settings for options. Using these templates, users can gain access to any portion of the full Manufacturing functionality, thus allowing for consistent and focused usage. Using these templates, users can also gain access to different sets of predefined values, which allow greater productivity in repetitive situations.
Five types of templates are available in the manufacturing environment: Operation, Method, Tool, Geometry, and Setup. Each one contains different data.
Operation templates are used to set values for all options within an operation. For example, there may be a template for point to point operations that includes all of the desired default settings for drilling. The data is stored as an operation itself, which is then retrieved to initialize the values for other operations.
Note:
Operation Templates initialize operation parameter values
Method templates control the setting of options that you want to be common throughout the setup. The options that can be defined as such are: stock, tolerances, feed rates and display parameters. The advantage of this capability is consistent machining throughout the setup while only having to specify values once.
Note:
Method Templates initialize setup option values
Tool templates control which types of tool assemblies (tool and holders) are available to be created in your CAM environment, and control the setting of default values for these tools. For example, you may want to limit the types of tools that can be created because you want to force the use of standard tools retrieved from a library. The advantage is great for customers with specialized libraries.
Note:
Tool Templates initialize available tools and their parameter values
Geometry templates control which type of geometry is available to be selected within the environment, and a machining sequence for that type of geometry. A geometry template can be defined for hole geometry, boundary geometry, face and body geometry, and turning boundaries. You can save a sequence of operation templates with each of the geometry templates. The advantage of this is that the user can establish a predefined process to machine a certain geometry feature. In the example, a sequence of center drill, drill and ream operation templates can be saved for the hole geometry group.
Note:
Geometry Templates initialize a sequence of operations for a given geometry type
Setup templates are used to initialize the entire CAM environment by providing any combination of operation, method, tool, and geometry templates at the same time. The setup is represented by all of the CAM data in the part.
Note:
Setup Templates initialize the entire manufacturing environment
Operation and group templates are classified with a user-defined type and subtype.
The type defines a collection of information that is used for one machining discipline. It is a part name that defines the part where the information is saved.
The subtype defines a collection of information that represents one specific process within that machining discipline. This specific process could be operation templates and/or group templates. For operation templates, the subtype is an operation within the part listed as the type. For group templates, the subtype is a group within the part listed as the type.
Output Control
You have control over the content and format of the output. The following outputs can be customized:
CLSF format
This is the format of the CLSF records. For example, NX includes three formats: Standard, BCL and ISO. You can then customize any additional formats.
Tool Path Listing format
This is the text format for output.
Shop floor documentation format
This defines the format for such capabilities as tool lists, operation sheets and process plans.
Machine Output format
This is the format of the PTP file. The format might be customizable depending on the desired machine tool/controller combination being used.
User Defined Events format
This is the format for output of postprocessor commands in the toolpath. This can be used to customize post sequences such as tool changes and load sequences.
NX Library
CAM offers the capability to store and retrieve information in libraries. This is very useful for information that is to be used repeatedly in many setups in a consistent manner. These libraries allow you to retrieve data into the setup. The libraries can be customized to include the exact type and content of data that is desired.
Library control is provided for tools, tool assemblies (tool plus holder), machine tools, machinability data (feeds/speeds), cut methods, and material (part plus tool).
Two versions of libraries are available; a text version and a full capability integrated library mechanism.
Process Assistants
Process Assistants allow you to control the sequence of NC programming activities to be presented in the user interface. The aid is a wizard like manufacturing process assistant. This processing assistant defines the sequence of NC programming activities to be presented in the user interface.
Note:
Geometry Templates initialize a sequence of operations for a given geometry
Manufacturing processing assistants control the sequence of interactive dialogs presented to the user for a sequence of operations. NX provides an initial set of Manufacturing processing assistants based upon extensive industry research. These are available within several products and product bundles. Currently, you may not create your own manufacturing processing assistants. This capability will be allowed in the future.
Manufacturing processing assistants are most productive when used in conjunction with manufacturing templates. For example, a geometry template can be used to define a sequence of operations (and their options) to be applied to a type of geometry (ie. a die). A processing assistant can then be applied to control the user interface. For example, the processing assistant can lead you to always be asked to select a tool or a Machine Coordinate System for each operation. A processing assistant can also allow the selection of tolerances to be by passed so that the default values are always used. An example of this can be seen by choosing the Mill contour die mold configuration, and selecting a mold or die sequence setup.
With these aids, you can customize the CAM interaction, process, and values to match your particular needs.
Configuration Management
The Configuration of the CAM system is the state of all of the customizable options at any one time. A configuration file keeps the record of these states and is the function used to define the customized environment.
The Manufacturing system is delivered with the configuration completely defined. There are several supplied configurations within which you can choose to work. If these are not appropriate, the system can be further or totally customized and then a new or modified configuration file used to define this new environment.
The supplied Configuration files include versions customized for each of three market segments: Mold and Die, Machinery, and High End.
The configuration file consists of a list of links that point to separate files. Each of these separate files, called reference files, contains the format for one type of customizable data.
All configuration files, whether supplied with the software, or created by the user, must have the same format: a key word followed by an environment variable. The key word identifies the type of data to be customized, and the environment variable identifies the location of a reference file that has the customized format for that data."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/cust_configuration,Manufacturing Configuration Files,"Manufacturing configuration files define the complete Manufacturing working environment. Each entry in the configuration file defines the location of a resource file that controls one aspect of the working environment, such as the available machining processors. You can use the configuration files supplied by NX, or create your own customized configuration files to define a working environment that meets your specific needs.

The configuration file.
This file defines the complete set of reference files required for the manufacturing setup. The default location is in the UGII_CAM_CONFIG_DIR folder. If you have a custom configuration file, it is in the UGII_CAM_CUSTOM_DIRfolder.
The template type part files. Each part file defines a set of object subtypes. The examples above show the subtypes defined for the mill_planar template.
The default locations for the template part files are in the UGII_CAM_TEMPLATE_PART_ENGLISH_DIR or UGII_CAM_TEMPLATE_PART_METRIC_DIR folders.
The file that defines which template part files to use with the selected configuration.
If your part has a library setup, NX looks in the UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TEMPLATE_DIR folder for the template.dat library file.
If you get unexpected results, then you can check to see if the Libref of your setup is in the setup library.
If your part has a non-library setup, NX looks in the UGII_CAM_LIBRARY_TEMPLATE_DIR folder for the template set file that is specified in the configuration file. For example, cam_general.opt.
Tip:
To see the folder location for an environment variable, search your log file. Choose Menu→Help→Log File.
To verify the type of setup in your work part, choose Menu→Information→Manufacturing Setup. If the manufacturing setup for your part is a library template, NX displays the Libref value. Standard inch templates have libref values from 001 to 100. Standard metric templates have libref values from 101 to 200. User defined templates should only use ibrefs greater than 200.

Each operation and group in the part files is a template with predefined parameters which may include numeric values. For example, Feed Rates and Stepover Distance. Templates can display customized object editing dialog boxes (""Create"" dialogs).
Template part files appear in the CAM Setup to Create group of the Machining Environment dialog box and in the Type options list in the operation and group creation dialog boxes.
Templates appear as the subtype icons available in the Create Operation dialog box and in the dialog boxes to create program, tool, geometry, and method groups. When you create a new operation or group, you select the object type to specify the desired template part, and select a subtype icon to specify the desired template. NX copies the template parameters into the new operation or parent group.
Templates also determine the groups that initially appear in the Operation Navigator when you first enter Manufacturing.
Tempate sets
A template set is a collection of template part files. The template set file has an .opt extension. The template set to use in a manufacturing setup is specified in the configuration file.
Template sets may be created and maintained by end-users or by system managers, depending on your work environment. Template sets are also provided and maintained by NX for each release. The standard NX supplied operation template sets use a specific naming convention and are located in the UGII_CAM_TEMPLATE_SET_DIR folder when initially installed on your system.
For more information, see Template Sets.
Changing the configuration and template set
To change the configuration and template set for your manufacturing setup, choose Menu→Preferences→Manufacturing→Configuration tab.
Note:
You can change both the configuration file, and the template set file for your setup. However, if your work part was saved with a manufacturing library setup, then NX sets the Template Set File option to the default setting for the selected configuration when you click Apply.
NX ignores the .opt template set file for library setups unless an object type is not found in the setup. NX then looks in the template set file.
Whenever you re-specify a template set, the available Type options in the object dialog boxes change to reflect the new template part files."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/cust_create_template,Make an operation or group a template,"A lead user or system administrator should manage the template part files for the rest of the user group. You can create template part files, or you can copy, customize, and rename templates supplied with the software. Template part files may contain many operations and many groups. You can specify which operations and groups are to be used as templates by choosing the Template Settings command in the Operation Navigator.
Note:
Operations and geometry groups used in templates should not have any geometry selected. To avoid possible errors and increase performance, remove all geometry from template parts that you use on a regular basis. The exception is part families because much of the geometry selected in the master will be retained in the family members.
To make an operation or group a template:
Open the template part file.
Highlight the desired operation(s) in the Operation Navigator.
Right-click and choose Object →Template Settings.
Select the Object can be used as a template check box to make the highlighted operation(s) or group subtype templates. Subtype operations are shown as Subtype options in the Create Operation dialog box.
(Optional) Select the Create if Parent is created check box to:
Create the highlighted operation whenever its geometry parent is used as a template.
Create the highlighted group whenever its parent is used as a template.
For example, any time you create an MCS geometry group, a WORKPIECE geometry group is created within it.
This allows you to make a single template that creates a hierarchy of several objects, and that maintains each operation's parents in the work part.
Click OK and save the part file in the appropriate folder with your other template files.
The parent group structure affects how the operation is placed in the Operation Navigator hierarchy:
If the parents already exist, the operation is placed in those parent groups.
If the parents do not exist, the new parent groups are created from the template part.
Note:
The software creates any missing parents in the same order as the operations. This means that the order of the program, method, and tool groups created in your work part may not match that of the original template part. If the order of these groups is critical, then create the groups first.
If all programs in a template part are loaded with the parent, you can use the top level program as a template, and all the programs will be created in the correct order. This will place all Create if Parent is created operations in the existing program groups.
If the operation has an Unused Items parent in the template part, then the user sets the parent from the Create Operation dialog box in the work part.
To create new operations from a custom template:
Open your part file.
Specify the custom template as the Type.
Note:
You may need to browse to the appropriate folder.
Any operations that were specified as templates appear as icons in the subtype section of the dialog box. Operations may use the default icons.
Customizing the icon and tooltip
You can add attributes to the object in the template part to define the icon and tool tip that appear in the Create Operation dialog box. To customize the icon or tool tip:
In the Operation Navigator, right–click the operation and choose Properties.
In the operation properties dialog box, from the Interaction Method list, select Traditional.
Define the following attributes as shown:
Title/Alias
Type
Value
Description
CAM_ICON
String
The icon bitmap file name
Specifies the icon to display for this object type in the Create Operation dialog box. It must either be an icon in the file system or an icon available in the NX bitmap folder. NX supports small, medium and large icon sizes in the Create Operation dialog box.
For a small icon size, the graphic size is 24 pixels wide by 24 pixels high.
For a medium icon size, the graphic size is 32 pixels wide by 32 pixels high.
For a large icon size, the graphic size is 48 pixels wide by 48 pixels high.
CAM_TOOLTIP
String
The tool tip title
Specifies the tooltip title to display for this object type in the Create Operation dialog box. If not defined, the title defaults to the object name. The maximum is 132 characters.
CAM_PICTURE
String
The tooltip bitmap file name
Specifies the graphic to display with the tooltip. The graphic size is 250 pixels wide by 200 pixels high.
CAM_TEXT
String
The first paragraph of the tooltip description.
Specifies the first paragraph of the tooltip description. The maximum is 132 characters
CAM_TEXT2
String
The second paragraph of the tooltip description.
Specifies the second paragraph of the tooltip description. The maximum is 132 characters
CAM_TEXT3
String
The third paragraph of the tooltip description.
Specifies the third paragraph of the tooltip description. The maximum is 132 characters
Custom icon locations
The software checks for a custom icon in the following locations, in the order listed:
If CAM_ICON contains a full path specification, checks for the icon at that location.
If CAM_ICON contains only the icon name, checks for the icon in the system, and then in the search path specified by the UGII_BITMAP_PATH environment variable, if it is defined.
If CAM_ICON is not specified, searches for an icon with the same name as the object in the search path specified by the UGII_BITMAP_PATH environment variable, if it is defined. To use this option, name your bitmaps exactly the same as your templates. For example: MY_CAVITY_MILL.bmp.
If the icon is not found at the search path specified by the UGII_BITMAP_PATH environment variable, uses the icon for this object type.
Refer to the Customizing NX documentation for more details on customizing dialogs.
Tooltip pictures
The software checks for a tooltip picture in the following locations, in the order listed:
If CAM_PICTURE contains a full path specification, checks for the graphic at that location.
If CAM_PICTURE contains only the bitmap name, checks in the following folders, in the order listed:
In each of the folders defined by the UGII_BITMAP_PATH environment variable, if it is defined.
For Windows this is a semicolon separated list. For other platforms, this is a colon separated list.
In each of the NX Open application subfolders listed in the custom_dirs.dat file.
In the standard $UGII_BITMAP_PATH\ugii\bitmaps folder.
or
In the standard $UGII_CAM_TEMPLATE_IMAGE_DIR folder.
Create if Parent is created
When you specify a template, NX uses the following logic to determine what is created:
In the work part, in each of the 4 views of the Operation Navigator, the root node and Unused Items group are created.
In the template part, in each of the 4 views, NX starts at the root node, searches for child groups that have Create if Parent is created selected, and creates these groups in the work part.
This search continues recursively all levels of children, until an object is reached that does not have Create if Parent is created selected. These objects are not copied and the search in that branch of the tree is complete.
In the Geometry View of the template part, during the search, if an operation with Create if Parent is created is encountered, then it is created in the work part, under the same geometry group.
Because each operation requires 4 parents, the other parents, Program, Tool, and Method are checked. If objects of the same name already exist in the work part, then the operation is placed under the existing groups. If corresponding object do not exist in the work part, they are created, and the operation is placed under the new group.
The typical use of Create if Parent is created is to apply it to operations in a geometry group.
When the geometry group is created, the operations are created, and the tools, programs, and methods that they reference.
In the following example, Object can be used as a template is selected for WORKPIECE which places WORKPIECE in the Create Geometry dialog box as a subtype icon. Create if Parent is created is also selected, which creates the WORKPIECE group every time its parent, MCS_MILL, is created as a group. For the MCS icon to appear in the Create Geometry dialog box, MCS_MILL must also be highlighted in the Operation Navigator and Object can be used as a template selected.
MCS_MILL
WORKPIECE
Whenever MCS_MILL is created as a group by selecting the subtype icon and Create, WORKPIECE is also created as illustrated below. Think of the Create if Parent is created option as meaning; ""whenever you create my parent group, the system automatically creates me too"".
Create if Parent is created is sometimes used to load a predefined sequence of operations. Although the specified operations must have four parents (a Program parent, a Tool parent, a Geometry Parent, and a Method parent), operations are loaded only when creating Geometry groups. This applies, for example, even if you specify Create if Parent is created in the Machine Tool View. The parent tool will not load the operations. The parent geometry loads the operations.
The Create if Parent is created option also allows you to determine which groups and operations in a Template Part File appear automatically in the Operation Navigator.
Specify Create if Parent is created for a continuous sequence of groups and operations, beginning at the root. All of the template groups and operations are created automatically, and appear in the Operation Navigator, when you select the template part as a Setup in the Machining Environment dialog box.
In the following figure, Create if Parent is created has been specified for MCS_MILL, WORKPIECE, CAVITY_MILL, and FIXED_CONTOUR. Because these groups and operations are in a contiguous, unbroken sequence, and because the selected sequence begins at the root (GEOMETRY), the groups and operations will be created automatically in the Operation Navigator when you initially specify the template part file as the setup.

https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/customize_cust_create_temp,Creating and Using Template Sets,"How to Create a Template Set
Template sets are useful because they make Template part files available for selection from within the dialog boxes, preventing you from having to browse for individual parts. A Template Set is an ASCII text file that lists the Part files containing templates as illustrated below. The default Template Set is determined by the Configuration File.
Note:
If you are in a Teamcenter environment, or if your configuration includes LIBRARY_SETUP_TEMPLATE, such as cam_library, then the list of template parts comes from the library and not the .opt file. See Data Management for more information.
Each Part file usually contains several Operations and Groups. A Drill Part file, for example, may contain a Center Drill, Drill, and Ream Operation. If too many template operations of the same type in a single part file are created, the Create dialogs can become too tall for the user interface.
When you create Operations or groups to be saved in the Part file, you may also want to customize the appearance of the Operation dialog box so that only those options appear when you later create Operations using the Template. Be sure to verify that in the Template Setting dialog box, the Object can be used as a template check box is selected.
Right-click the operation and choose Object→Template Settings.
Once the Template Part files have been created and saved, you will group them together logically into Template Sets. A Template Set is defined by creating an ASCII text file as illustrated below. This text file must contain the path name and the file name of each Template Part file in the set, and must be saved with a .opt extension. You may insert commentary text after ## characters.
ASCII Text File Defining a Template Set
Note:
English and Metric template files are mutually exclusive. This is intentional, as it allows Operation defaults for either English or Metric units.
Save the ASCII text file in the desired folder. Be sure to include the .opt extension. In this example the text file is saved as: /cam/temp/templ1.opt .
Note:
You can embed environmental variables in the Part file name.
Once Template Sets have been created, you may select which set to use when creating new Operations. For this example, we will assume that the following Template Sets have been created:
/cam/temp/templ1.opt /cam/temp/templ2.opt /cam/temp/templ3.opt
How to Select a Template Set
To specify which template set to use, do the following:
Choose Menu→Preferences→Manufacturing.
Click the Configuration tab.
In the Template Set group, click Browse .
Select the desired Template Set from the file list.
You can only specify one template set.
Click OK to confirm the selection.
In the Manufacturing Preferences dialog box, click OK.
NX scans the Template Part files in the selected set to determine which have matching units (inch/metric) and to define the Type and Subtype options that will appear in the Operation and Group creation dialog boxes. When a Template is retrieved, some parameters are reoriented based on the the Reference Coordinate System (RCS) found in the MCS or other geometry orientation groups. NX will continue to use the specified Template Set for the remainder of your logon session or until you specify another Template Set.
Note:
Although the Status line indicates that the Template Part files are being ""Loaded"", they are actually being ""scanned"" to check the units and to define the Type and Subtype options that will appear in the Operation Definition section of the Operation Parameters dialog box. The Template Part files are not being ""loaded"" in the usual sense of the word in that they are not being copied in as data sets.
Note:
While in manufacturing, the template part that is currently selected will be open throughout the session.
How to Select a Template
The Template Set you have selected determines the Type options and the available Subtype icons that will appear in both the Create Operation and Create Group dialog boxes.
The Type options correspond to the Template Part file names. The Subtype options (icons) correspond to the Operation and Group names within the Template Part file (Type). The selected Type determines which Subtype options (icons) are available.
The Name field indicates the name that will be used when you create the operation or group.
Tools will only be created with an operation if the operation template has Create if Parent is created toggled ON. If the template loads a tool with the same name but different parameters as a tool in the current Part file, a new tool with different name is created and is associated with the new operation.
Once you have specified the Type and Subtype, select OK or Apply to make a new Operation or Group that uses the parameters defined by the Type and Subtype.
How to Reset Back to the System Default Template Set
Choose Menu→Preferences→Manufacturing.
Click the Configuration tab.
In the Template Set group, click Reset to Default .
The default Template Set is determined by the Configuration File. You may also change the active Template Set by specifying a different Configuration File using the Specify Configuration File button.
Summary
Here is a summary of key points and a diagram that illustrates how the various aspects of Templates relate to one another.
A Template is an Operation or Group saved in a Template Part File.
A Template Part file is Part file containing CAM Operations and Groups with specific pre-defined parameters and customized dialogs.
A Template Set is a collection (logical grouping) of Template Part files. It is an ASCII text file with an .opt extension.
The specified Template Set determines the Type options and Subtype icons you have to select from when creating a new Operation or Group.
All new CAM Operations and Groups are defined using Templates.
Templates are useful because they prevent you from having to redefine parameters from a set of standard system defaults each time you begin a new Operation or Group."

LIBRARY_SETUP_TEMPLATE affects the behavior of setup templates as described in Setup Library and Setup Assemblies below.
LIBRARY_CAM_OUTPUT affects how and where output files are stored as described in Output Classification Library below.
Note:
Do not switch between Teamcenter and native environments during a session
It is recommended that users start NX in either Teamcenter or native, with the correct CAM configuration specified to match. If a user needs to work in CAM in both environments, they should have two ways to start NX, so that the CAM configuration is set before NX is started.

A setup template may be an assembly that contains a ""target component"". When this setup is used a new assembly is created for CAM and your current work part becomes a component in this assembly. The setup can also contain geometry or other components such as fixtures.
The following example describes how this works.
Open a part named Part_A.prt in Manufacturing and select GENERAL from the Library Class Selection list.
Select General Assembly in either the inch or metric format and click OK.
The setup is created with a temporary name: Part_A_setup_1.prt.
Begin creating your NC Program in this file while referencing Part_A.prt in your NX window.
When you are ready, select Save. Either keep the default name, Part_A_setup_1.prt, or enter a new name such as Part_A_CAM.prt
You now have two separate files: the CAD part we originally opened named Part_A.prt, and the file in which you create the NC program named Part_A_setup_1.prt. Part_A.prt is now a component of Part_A_setup_1.prt.
You can create several CAM assemblies for a single work part. This allows you to divide the CAM data in several files, or allow several programmers to be working on the same part.
To create a CAM setup that uses assemblies, add a simple component to represent a typical work part. Assign the attribute CAM_COMPONENT_TYPE=Target. When this setup is used, the target component is replaced with your work part. For the other components of the assembly, assign the attribute CAM_COMPONENT_TYPE=Resource.
Note:
Name attributes and mating conditions can be used in the setup template to locate the target component relative to clamps, fixtures, or other resources. If your work part has the same name attributes, the mating conditions allow the work part to be positioned correctly when replacing the target component.  
Note:
After you have created a setup assembly, if you delete the setup, the assembly is not deleted. If you create another assembly setup, a new assembly is not created -- the setup is created in your work part."

The variable UGII_CAM_SETUP_ROOT_DIR defines a root folder for CAM output files. For each part a folder is created with the same name as the part file. For each type of output, another folder is created to indicate the output type.
For example, in PART_A_CAM.prt you generate a ptp file for PROGRAM2 using the MILL_3_AXIS postprocessor. In the output area, the file is stored in part_a_cam\mill_3_axis\ program2.ptp.

The Cavity Milling Tool Sequence Wizard creates a geometry group that contains a sequence of cavity milling operations. This sample creates five operations that use tool holder collision checking. Each operation uses a longer tool and cuts only the material that could not be reached by the shorter tools in the previous operations.
The Mold Zlevel Wizard creates a geometry group that contains a sample z-level-based mold machining process.

A Logic step is defined primarily through step connectors rather than within the step itself. The outcome of the Logic step is determined by the defined connectors.
Creating a Logic Step
You define a Logic step by constructing two or more boolean statements that determine the next step. The first true statement encountered will select that path for the next step. The last choice is the default option, which always executes as true.
To create a logic step:
Select the Logic step icon and drag it to the graphics window, or double-click.
Create the outcome steps for the Logic step. Then, with the Group step area of the Logic step selected, use MB3 to create connectors to each of the outcome step choices.
If necessary, select each connector originating from the Logic step, and use MB3 to edit the connector attributes. For example, you can modify the order of the connectors, which determines the evaluation sequence when the Logic step runs in the wizard.
With the connector selected, edit the properties and values for the connector, if necessary.
The last choice step you create, by default, is always accepted as true.
Using a Logic Step
On the consumer side, the Logic step displays as a dialog in the wizard. The dialog automatically evaluates the boolean choice statements defined by the authoring tool to determine the number of step options. Each detected step option is displayed in the wizard as an action button.
Based on the software's evaluation of the boolean statements, an automatic selection of one of the Logic step choices is made. The end user can agree with the selected choice or select another choice. The process continues in the wizard as the user selects Next or any of the other available options.
Note:
If you do not want the dialog to be visible in the Manufacturing Wizard, select Auto Execute for the step."

Denotes UG/Open API Function
 <area>
This is usually an acronym for the application or area of functionality. For example, MODL and DISP are acronyms for the Modeling application and Display functions respectively.
 <name>
The name is broken down into a verb and noun separated by an underscore. For example, UF_MODL_create_block1 is Open C and C++ Modeling routine to create a block. UF_DISP_set_highlight is a function that turns an object's highlight on or off."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/Steps_usrdef_nxdialog,NX Dialog Step,"The NX Dialog (MenuScript) step allows you to provide existing NX application dialogs as part of the Manufacturing Wizard. The dialog launches in NX and then returns to the wizard when the end user selects OK or Cancel.
Note:
For more information, see MenuScript User's Guide.
MenuScript Concepts
The NX Dialog or MenuScript step uses the same menuscript buttons as those found in NX .men files. As shown in the following example, ug_sfem.men leads to UG_SFEM_INSERT_PARTITION_SOLID, which invokes the Partition dialog.
BUTTON UG_SFEM_INSERT_PARTITION_SOLID
LABEL &Partition Model...
BITMAP split.bmp
ACTIONS STANDARD
Options available in the NX Dialog step include a Menubar specification and a Button specification. The Menubar element identifies user-defined menu bars and buttons. If you don't specify a Menubar string, the NX internal menu bars will search for the Button definition.
NX Dialog Guidelines
The NX Dialog step use may be restricted in the Manufacturing Wizard by the NX UI state. For example, while in the Structures application, many dialogs are turned off because their actions are not appropriate to the Structures application. Available dialogs are therefore determined by the UI state. If the process is being run in the Manufacturing Wizard and the current UI state restricts access to a particular button definition, the NX Dialog-defined step will display a status message and will skip that step.
Since there is no wizard dialog for the NX Dialog step, meaning that in the Manufacturing Wizard the target dialog simply appears, you may want to add a Message step before the NX Dialog step to display additional information, or to point to additional information for the benefit of the consumer.

There may be times that you need to create connectors manually, for example, if you want to add a new step in between two existing steps. To create a connector manually:
If necessary, delete the existing connector.
Right-click in the group step area of the ""from"" step, then select Create Connector.
Click inside the ""to"" step. The connector appears.
Deleting Connectors
To delete a connector, right-click with the cursor positioned over the connector, and select Delete Connector.
Modifying Connectors
You can choose between line and elbow-shaped connectors. Right-click over the connector and select Elbow Connector or Line Connector. For the Logic step, you can also change the order of the connectors originating from that step."

https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/cust_wiz_storing_files,Storing Manufacturing Wizard Files,"Manufacturing Wizards and associated files (icons, help files) must be stored as follows:
You must store all XML files in UGII_CAM_WIZARD_DIR.
The wizard preview image (shown on the palette) is loaded from UGII_CAM_WIZARD_DIR if the graphic is present there.
Icons in the wizard dialogs and help files are loaded from UGII_SPSD_PATH if present there.
If the icons are not present in UGII_SPSD_PATH, the system first looks in the internal bitmap table for the icon and then in UGII_BITMAP_PATH.
The variable UGII_SPSD_PATH is not set automatically by the system. You have to set it by hand. If the variable UGII_SPSD_PATH is not defined in an NX session, the manufacturing wizards define it as UGII_SPSD_PATH = UGII_CAM_WIZARD_DIR. If the variable UGII_SPSD_PATH is defined in an NX session, the manufacturing wizards append UGII_CAM_WIZARD_DIR to the existing contents of UGII_SPSD_PATH. The variable can contain multiple paths separated by the platform-specific path separator (as in other file search paths, for example, $PATH). The variable can reference other environment variables in its content.
Tip:
To define the default folder for the Save dialog in Simulation Process Studio, create a file called portal_user.properties containing the following line:
com.eds.plm.ProcessStudioHome = path to Wizard templates
The path to Wizard templates is usually UGII_BASE_DIR\MACH\resource\wizard.
Place this file in the Simulation Process Studio main folder where portal.bat is located. In a standard NX installation, this is UGII_BASE_DIR\pstudio."

These UDEs may be specified at the start of a tool path, at the end of a tool path, and even in the middle of a path. In general, UDEs activate postprocessor commands in the order in which you specify them.
In a CLSF output file, the Start of Path Events post commands are output before the first GOTO command. End of Path Events post commands are output at the end of the tool path. The commands ORIGIN and CUTCOM have special placement rules. See the discussion of these commands for more detailed information.
If you specify a FROM or START POINT (as avoidance parameters), the default output position for postprocessor commands is after the FROM and before the START POINT. An ORIGIN command will precede the FROM position. For example:
If you specify a RETURN or GOHOME (as avoidance parameters), the default output position for postprocessor commands is after the RETURN and before the GOHOME. For example:
Note:
This default positioning can be overridden by specifying positioning markers."

User Defined Events (UDEs)
Start of Path Events and End of Path Events let you add machine control events such as coolant or other post commands to the start and end of your operation.
Copy From
Lets you copy special post commands from another operation or from an operation template.
Edit
Lets you add post commands to the start or end of the path.
For some operations, you can define UDEs at the following levels:
Boundaries.
Boundary members. These are identified using Custom Boundary Data.
Boundary groups.
Motion Output
Lets you convert linear, arc, and curve data generated in an operation to other motion types when you postprocess the tool path.
Milling operation options
Linear Only
In this mode, circular motions are linearized, that is, split into small linear segments. No CIRCLE/GOTO events are output to the tool path.
Arc — Perp to Tool Axis
Generates all of the possible circular tool motions that lie in planes that are normal to the tool axis.
Arc — Perp/Par to Tool Axis
Generates all of the possible circular tool motions that lie in planes that are normal or parallel to the tool axis.
Nurbs
Generates all of the possible circular tool motions and Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline curves where posssible.
Available for Fixed-axis Surface Contouring, Planar Milling, Cavity Milling, Face Milling, Floor Wall Milling, Groove Milling.
Lets you control the surface finish by determining how accurately the tool path follows Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline curves (Nurbs).
Nurbs causes the tool to drive along Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline curves (up to order 4 [degree 3] cubic splines) rather than along approximate line/arc segments. This option should be used for fixed axis machining, when the tool axis is aligned with the ZM axis, to perform high speed operations requiring a very smooth and accurate surface cut (particularly on contoured surfaces) and when your Fanuc, Seimens, Heidenhain, or Fidia UNC control supports Nurbs input. The finished part should not deviate from the design geometry more than the specified Intol/Outtol if the defined Fitting Control Tolerance is within the Intol/Outtol band. If a smoother tool path is desired, you can specify a tighter Fitting Control Tolerance. When using this option, the tool displays only at the beginning and end of each cutting pass regardless of the specified Display Frequency.
See User Defined operations and CLSF for the Standard B-Spline Format.
Sinumerik Spline
Outputs splines for Siemens Sinumerik controllers. The Sinumerik Spline output is optimized for Zig cut patterns in finishing operations, and is best suited for the Area Mill drive method.
The spline format uses G2 continuity where possible. This helps to ensure that the tool paths run smoothly. The tool path is expected to run faster and produce a smoother surface finish. The spline may also be used with other controllers.
Turning operation options
Linear Only
In this mode, circular motions are linearized, that is, split into small linear segments. No CIRCLE/GOTO events are output to the tool path.
Circular
Circular motions are not split into linear motions, but output as one single CIRCLE/GOTO event.
Machine Cycle
Circular motions are not split. In addition, a CYCLE/ON event is add added to the start of the tool path and a CYCLE/OFF event is added at the end of the path.
Note:
Circle records output to the CLSF or NC file are generated from either selected geometry or the postprocessor. If the radius of the circle is outside the range defined in the postprocessor, then the postprocessor outputs a warning indicating that the radius is out of range. The warning does not indicate an error since the postprocessor automatically converts the arc into one or more linear segments."

The default file is ${UGII_CAM_USER_DEF_EVENT_DIR}ude.cdl. The keyword USER_DEFINED_EVENTS in a manufacturing configuration file, for example, ${UGII_CAM_CONFIG_DIR}lathe.dat, determines the default .cdl file and the corresponding Tcl code file to be used for user-defined events.
In the .cdl file, in the next non-comment line after the MACHINE keyword, enter one or more statements to include other files.
The format to include a file is:
INCLUDE {file specification}
For example:
INCLUDE {$UGII_CAM_USER_DEF_EVENT_DIR/Siemens_Cycles.cdl}
Caution:
If you use a library machine tool, be aware that the definition file for the machine's default postprocessor also contains a pointer to a user-defined event file. The code that points to the file is, by default, the following:
INCLUDE {$UGII_CAM_USER_DEF_EVENT_DIR/ude.cdl}
You must edit any files with conflicting pointers to remove the conflicts.
This method of implementing your events has the following advantages:
It minimizes the effort required when you configure a new NX release.
It makes it much simpler to manage potential conflicts due to the pointer in library machine tools.
If NX is already running when you add a custom user-defined event file, you must reread the manufacturing environment to which you added the events.
(Optional) Create an online Help file, name.html, to support your custom event and place it in the folder pointed to by the environment variable UGII_CAM_USER_DEF_EVENT_DIR.

Step 1: Specify Output File Parameters
The Geometry Definition option displays the following dialog box. Most of these options pertain to triangulating the solid or sheet bodies. Once you have specified these parameters, you will select OK to specify the .ply output file name.
In order to process the solid or sheet bodies, the system must determine surface adjacencies, triangulate each surface making sure all edge vertices match, and determine normals to the triangles which point toward the outside of the surfaced body. To process the selected bodies, the system directly triangulates them and then outputs the triangles and normals to the .ply output file for use with Vericut. The coordinates of the triangulated in the .ply output file are in the Absolute Coordinate System.
Triangulated Body
The accuracy of the triangulation processing for surfaces is dependent upon three factors: 1) the edge tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation, 2) the trim tolerance used in Trim Surface, 3) the triangulation tolerance.
The edge and trim tolerances determine how accurately the surface edges stored in the data base are positioned in relation to the true edges. Triangles along the edge of a surface have one or more vertices on the edge stored in the data base. Thus, inaccuracies in the edges stored in the data base result in inaccuracies in triangles along the edge of a surface.
It is imperative that you understand and set the tolerances correctly. Triangle Tol (triangulation tolerance) determines how smooth the approximation of the surface/solid will be. The smaller this number, the more triangular facets the system will generate as it attempts to simulate smoother contoured surfaces (see the Triangulation Tolerances figure). Adjacency Tol (adjacency tolerance) determines when two surfaces meet along an edge. You must be sure to coordinate this adjacency tolerance with other tolerances used throughout NX.
The Edge Tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation and the Trim Tolerance used in Trim Surface determine the number of curve segments stored in the data base as an approximation of a surface edge. The smaller the tolerance, the more numerous the curve segments used to approximate an edge. When the system processes the triangulation of the surfaced model, it creates at least one triangle for each curve segment. As a result, the edge tolerance and surface trim tolerance determine the lower bound of the number of triangles produced. The number of triangles is the key determining factor in the speed of the processing.
Given the minimal set of triangles determined by the edge and trim tolerance, the Triangulation Tolerance determines how many more triangles are needed to obtain the accuracy desired.
To obtain the best performance possible, use the largest edge, trim, and Triangulation Tolerances possible to meet your needs. This will allow the system to correctly determine the adjacencies and to sufficiently provide accurate triangular approximation of the surfaces.
Each option in the Geometry Definition dialog box is described below.
Geometry
This option is always set to Part and cannot be changed.
Output Type
Output Type allows you to specify the type of file in which the system stores the output. This option toggles between Binary and Text.
Text creates an ASCII text output file that you can read and edit, although it takes up more memory space than a binary file.
Binary creates a binary output file. This produces the file in a more compact and efficient form, but which you cannot read or understand without some translation. The system defaults to this option.
Triangle Tol
Triangulation Tolerance allows you to enter a tolerance value which determines:
how closely the triangles approximate the surface contours
how close the sides of the triangles which lie along the edges are to the edges of the surface
The smaller the value you enter, the more triangles the system will generate as it simulates smoother contoured surfaces. More triangular facets require more processing time.
Triangulation Tolerances
English part values must range from .0001 to .1 inches with a default of .02. Metric part values must range from .0025 to 2.5 mm with a default of .5.
Adjacency Tol
Adjacency Tolerance allows you to enter a value which the system uses to determine if two surfaces will be attached to one another. The distance between two surface boundaries, as found in the data base, is calculated. If that distance is less than the Adjacency Tolerance, the two boundaries are considered to be coincident and the two surfaces are considered to be attached along that boundary. The default value for the Adjacency Tolerance is .005 for English parts, .12 for metric parts.
The Adjacency Tolerance has no affect on the speed of processing the solids.
A boundary, as found in the data base, is an approximation of the true surface edge. For example, when a cylinder is trimmed by a bounded plane which is not perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, the true edge of the cylinder is an ellipse, but the system stores an approximating curve in the data base rather than an actual ellipse. This curve is accurate to within the trim tolerance specified when the surface was trimmed.
Elliptical Trim of a Cylinder which Results in an Approximating Curve
As a result, you must coordinate the setting of the Adjacency Tolerance with the trim tolerance used in Trim Surface (and similarly, the edge tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation)
Use the following as rough guidelines for specifying Adjacency Tolerances.
Note:
 To avoid encountering problems with the Adjacency Tolerance, you must design NX parts with these general guidelines in mind:
When creating a bounded plane, use an edge tolerance which is less than or equal to one-half the Adjacency Tolerance.
Likewise, when trimming a surface, use a trim tolerance which is less than or equal to one-half the Adjacency Tolerance you will use.
To produce reasonable results, set the edge and trim tolerances within a range from .001 to .0025 for English parts, .0254 to .0635 for metric parts.
For the Adjacency Tolerance, set the value within a range from .0001 to .05 English, .0025 to 1.2 metric.
There is one exception to these rough guidelines. If, when creating the part:
the edge tolerance in bounded plane creation and the trim tolerance in surface trim is less than or equal to the default tolerance of .01 inches
and the edges of two adjacent surfaces are endpoint to endpoint coincident (i.e., the 3D endpoints of the two edges coincide)
then these edges will always be correctly identified as adjacent regardless of the setting of the Adjacency Tolerance.
For example, the adjacencies for all surfaces created by the Automatic Surfacing function within NX will be correctly determined because in this case adjacent surface edges are always endpoint to endpoint coincident and the edge tolerance used by Automatic Surfacing in the creation of bounded planes is .01 inches.
Note:
Edges whose length are smaller than the Adjacency Tolerance can cause adjacency problems if they are not endpoint to endpoint coincident. So it is best to construct surfaces so that adjacent edges are endpoint to endpoint coincident whenever possible. Not only will it help the correct determination of adjacencies, but it will also speed up the computation of those adjacencies.
In general, any surface construction tolerance should be approximately 50% of the smallest machining tolerance (i.e., Intol/Outtol tolerance).
The system handles these edges whose length is less than the Adjacency Tolerance in the following manner:
If an edge has length less than the Adjacency Tolerance and the neighboring edges are not endpoint to endpoint adjacent, the system displays the error message More Than 2 Edges Adjacent. In most cases, the output file will be successfully processed by Vericut.
Small Edge Length Produces an Error
If an edge has length less than the adjacency tolerance and the neighboring edges are endpoint to endpoint adjacent, the system correctly determines the adjacencies.
Adjacencies Correctly Determined Along a Small Edge
Max Triangle Edge
Maximum Triangle Edge allows you to assign a maximum triangle edge length for generated triangles. This option toggles between OFF and on, with OFF being the default. When turned on, this option activates the Triangle Edge Size field below. When turned OFF, the system applies no limit to the triangle size.
For normal rapid prototyping use, this option can usually be set to OFF. However, when the resulting .ply file is used for some other application (such as Vericut), it may be necessary to apply a maximum triangle size.
Triangle Edge Size
Triangle Edge Size sets the value of the maximum triangle edge size. This value has no affect if the Maximum Triangle Edge option is OFF. If it is ON, the system guarantees that no triangle edge will exceed the specified value.
Triangle Display
Triangle Display allows you to temporarily display the triangles used to create the Vericut simulation. This option toggles between OFF and ON, with OFF the default. When turned ON, this option gives you the ability to visually check the triangulation of the entities for smoothness and any potential problems. The system displays the triangles in the current system display color.
Step 2: Specify Output File Name
Once you have specified each option in the Geometry Definition dialog box, select OK. The system then displays the following dialog box and prompts you to name the .ply output file.
The system automatically appends the default extension .ply to the file name if the file is binary. It appends the default extension .txt to the file name if the file is a text file.
The system checks to see if the entered file name currently exists. If it does (or if you select an existing name in the list), the system prompts you to either:
Use Other Name
Replace It
Append to It
You can use Append to It to put two related parts into one Vericut file.
Step 3: Select Geometry
After you specify the output file name, the system displays the Class Selection dialog box with the mask set to only allow selection of solid bodies and sheet bodies. In this step, you will select the bodies to which the system will apply the triangulation. The geometry you select represents the material to be simulated as illustrated below.
Selecting Part vs. Stock Geometry
Generally, you will select the modeled Blank Geometry to simulate the removal of stock.
Error Messages
The system may also display error messages if problems were encountered in processing the selected surfaces or solids. These are NX error messages.
For all error messages, the system highlights the offending edge, surface, or solid face, and then prompts you to either Continue Displaying Errors or Discontinue.
Choose Continue Displaying Errors for the system to resume highlighting each offending edge, surface, or solid face. Choose Discontinue to stop the output of this error message.
When the system has finished the processing of this error message it continues with subsequent processing and produces a Vericut output file.
The following error messages are non-fatal:
Edges Not Shared By Two Surfaces
Any edges which are not shared by two surfaces are detected. The system highlights all such edges of a surface and displays this error message.
There are two conditions which generate this message:
Two surface edges that should be adjacent are found not to be. This may be caused by inexact modeling, or a violation of the guidelines for specifying adjacency tolerances. A single surface file is acceptable to Vericut for Auto Difference checking. Refer to the Vericut documentation for a description of the Auto Difference option.
The edge is part of a support structure and you do not want the edge to be attached to any other edge. In this case, consider the message to be only a warning and continue running the process.
Normals Cannot Be Automatically Determined
When calculating the normals for surfaces, you choose a base surface to establish a correct normal for the model. If your selection of surfaces contains more than one body (a body being a group of surfaces that are all attached to one another), the system highlights all surfaces that are not connected via a chain of surfaces to the base surface and displays this error message. The system then continues the processing and will use the normals stored in the NX data base for all offending surfaces. Note that the normals for such surfaces may be incorrect.
The following figure shows a part containing two separate bodies of surfaces. Since the second body selected is not connected by a chain of surfaces to the base surface, the system highlights it and displays the error message.
System Interaction when it Cannot Determine Normals
If the surfaces highlighted are merely support structures, consider the message to be merely a warning; you can still use the output. Otherwise, make sure all the normals for all highlighted surfaces are correct. The Append to It option is ideally suited for handling this situation. Run the process once for each body, appending to the previous output file.
Fatal Errors
The following error messages are fatal. The resulting output file may not be processed successfully by Vericut.
More Than 2 Edges Adjacent
If more than two surfaces coincide along an edge, the system highlights the offending coincident edges and displays this error message. There are two conditions which can generate this message:
The edge has length less than the adjacency tolerance and the neighboring edges are not endpoint to endpoint adjacent. In most cases, the output file will be processed successfully by Vericut.
Three or more surfaces meet along this edge.
Degenerate Surface
Certain surfaces can be constructed in NX but are degenerate. The system highlights all such surfaces and displays this error message. There are five ways in which a surface can be degenerate.
If the surface only consists of two boundary curves which coincide (see Example A).
If two of the boundary curves of a surface coincide (see Example B)
If a hole was trimmed into a surface that lies directly on one boundary (see Example C)
If a hole crosses a surface boundary (see Example D)
The distance between a hole and the periphery is less than two times the edge tolerance used in Bounded Plane Creation or the trim tolerance used in Trim Surface (see Example E).
Ways in which a Surface is Degenerated
Unable To Triangulate Surface
The system cannot triangulate the surface due to surface being corrupted, or because of a programming error.
Unable To Triangulate Solid Face
The system cannot triangulate the solid due to a programming error.
Virtual Memory Exhausted
If at any time during processing a dynamic memory call runs out of space, the system immediately stops the process, frees all dynamically allocated space, and displays this error message."
https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfggeneral/xid1967924,Teamcenter Integration for NX Manufacturing,"In Teamcenter Integration for NX, the Teamcenter data management tool runs as a separate process at the same time as NX. Since the two programs communicate, you can create, store, and access your NX data within the Teamcenter database.
CAM configurations in Teamcenter Integration for NX Manufacturing
Teamcenter Integration for NX Manufacturing combines the power of NX Manufacturing with the power of Teamcenter in storing and retrieving data in a controlled fashion. Within Teamcenter Integration for NX Manufacturing, there are different methods to access Manufacturing data.
Creating a new CAM setup part file
When Manufacturing is not active and you use File→New→Manufacturing in NX to create a CAM setup part, the configuration is defined in nxdm_ugs_manufacturing_templates.pax.
Example:
<Filename>@DB/mill_planar_assy_inch/A</Filename>
            <Configuration>${UGII_CAM_CONFIG_DIR}cam_teamcenter_ascii_library.dat</Configuration>
            <LibraryClassPath>SETUP_TEMPLATE;GENERAL</LibraryClassPath>
The nxdm_ugs_manufacturing_templates.pax file can be stored in Teamcenter, or on the operating system. NX uses the file on the operating system if your NX installation is not set up to use the pax files inside of Teamcenter.
The same rules for all other pax files apply to this file.
When you open a non-CAM part in managed mode and then switch to Manufacturing, NX uses the configuration defined in template_part_planner.dat to create a new CAM setup part. The template_part_planner.dat file is stored in the Teamcenter UGCAMTemplateData data set.
Beginning with NX 1980, the part planner data set file is version specific, so that you can access the correct template files when your company runs multiple versions of NX in managed mode.
Example:
Release
Part planner file
Example template entry in part planner file
NX 1980
template_part_planner_NX1980.dat
@DB/mill_planar_inch_NX1980/A
NX 2007
template_part_planner_NX2007.dat
@DB/mill_planar_inch_NX2007/A
Note:
If the version-specific file is not added, NX uses the configuration defined in the template_part_planner.dat file.
In Teamcenter, the template_part_planner.dat and template_part_planner_[NX version].dat files are stored as Named References in the following location:
User = infodba
Dataset = UGCAMTemplateData

If a CAM configuration is not defined, NX displays the Machining Environment dialog box so that you can select a CAM session configuration. You can select cam_part_planner_mrl if the Manufacturing Resource Library (MRL) is installed with your Teamcenter installation. Select cam_teamcenter_ascii_library if MRL is not installed.
When you are in an active NX Manufacturing session, NX uses the current CAM configuration to create a new setup part.
Opening an existing CAM setup part file
When you start a new NX session in managed mode, and open an existing CAM setup part, NX uses the cam configuration file defined in UGII_CAM_CONFIG.
Your site may use a standard library type of cam configuration to ensure that other cam data, such as posted code files, are imported into Teamcenter. If so, set UGII_CAM_CONFIG to point to the same cam configuration .dat file that is defined in the nxdm_ugs_manufacturing_templates.pax file. This step ensures that NX uses the same cam configuration whether you create a new setup, or you retrieve and reopen an old setup.
UGII_CAM_IMAN_TYPE_TEMPLATE
The UGII_CAM_IMAN_TYPE_TEMPLATE environment variable points to an .opt file that contains a list of template parts. The default .opt file is cam_teamcenter_general.opt.
When a Manufacturing setup part cannot find the type template data from template_part_planner.dat, NX uses the list of template parts in the .opt file that UGII_CAM_IMAN_TYPE_TEMPLATE points to.
Example:
A Manufacturing setup part is imported from Native NX to NX in managed mode.
In this case, NX is unable to find the type template data.
UGII_CAM_IMAN_TYPE_TEMPLATE points to cam_teamcenter_general.opt, the default file.
NX uses the template files listed in cam_teamcenter_general.opt.

Note:
When the pax file defines the available templates, you choose File→New in NX to create a CAM setup.
It is not necessary to store and manage the pax file in Teamcenter. You can store the pax on your operating system, and NX will use it from there if the site is not set up to use the pax files inside of Teamcenter. All the same rules for this pax file apply as for any others.

mom_device_path
mom_device_path_ids
mom_tool_id
In Teamcenter Manufacturing Process Planner, the Activities tab displays the MOM variable content in columns. You can configure which user attributes and which MOM variables to display in the columns.
For information on how to enable user variables and display MOM variables in Teamcenter, see Synchronize NX CAM to Teamcenter custom user tooling data in the Managing Manufacturing Data document.
mom_device_path
The Device Path column displays the mounting path for tools when mom_device_path is active.
For each device in the mounting path for a tool, the NX CAM name displays in a comma-separated list. This lets you see, in Teamcenter, the NX names for the devices in which the tool instance is mounted. The device information also tells shop floor personnel how to mount tools correctly.
Example:
Teamcenter Manufacturing Process Planner, Activities tab
Line
Device Path
Description

SPOT_DRILL
2
NXT_MILL_13_00026_A
HEAD_POCKET_1, BENZ_ANGLE_HEAD, MACH_POCKET, SPINDLE
FLOOR_FACING

The Device Path column lets you see if tool orientation information is included in the NX name for a device.
Example:
Teamcenter Manufacturing Process Planner, Activities tab
Line
Device Path
UGT0111_001
R_POCKET_1,DUO_TURN_TOOLHOLDER,POCKET_05
mom_device_path_ids
The Device Path IDs column displays the mounting path for tools when mom_device_path_ids is active.
In this column, the Teamcenter item and revision ID for each device in the mounting path for a tool displays in a comma-separated list. The Teamcenter item IDs are in double quotes to indicate the information comes from Teamcenter. If a device is not stored in Teamcenter, the NX name is displayed. In the following example, only the angle head is stored in Teamcenter.
Example:

mom_tool_id
The Tool ID column displays the item revision ID for tools when mom_tool_id is active. Displaying the item revision ID helps you to identify the multi-tool item in the BOM that belongs to an activity line. The following example is for a multi-tool that has two occurrences in the BOM.
Example:
Teamcenter Manufacturing Process Planner, BOM view, CAM setup tab
BOM Line
