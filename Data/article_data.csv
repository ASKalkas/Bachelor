https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Introducing-the-NC-Optimizer-A-New-Approach-to-Postprocessing,Introducing the NC Optimizer: A New Approach to Postprocessing,"IntroductionThe NC Optimizer is a cutting-edge technology designed to revolutionize the way postprocessing is handled. It brings a series of enhancements to the post core and Post Configurator library, offering a range of benefits over traditional postprocessing.Unlike conventional Post Configurator postprocessors, the NC Optimizer, built on advanced technology, eliminates the need for a pretreatment run. Instead, it directly accesses information through the MOM extension (post core API) and allowing post writers to make direct changes to NC lines before they are output to a file.The advantages of the NC Optimizer are twofold. First, it delivers superior performance, ensuring optimized postprocessing results. Second, it offers easy customization, giving users the flexibility to tailor the postprocessor to their specific needs.NC Optimizer now is available in NX2406 as Early Access Feature ""Enable NC Optimize"".Creating an NC Optimizer PostprocessorTo create an NC Optimizer postprocessor, follow these simple steps:Note: It is an Early Access Feature in NX2406, need to set ""Enable NC Optimize"" to On to access it.Open the Post Configurator tool and navigate to the ""Create New Postprocessor"" dialogue.In the dialogue, make sure to check the Enable NC Optimizer checkbox.Once you have successfully created the NC Optimizer postprocessor, you will notice a few differences in the library folder.Specifically, you will no longer find the lib_pretreatment.tcl, lib_pretreatment.def and lib_pretreatment_post.tbc files that are present in traditional postprocessors.Instead, you will find a new file called lib_nc_optimizer.tbc in the library folder.By eliminating the need for pretreatment files and introducing the lib_nc_optimizer.tbc file, the NC Optimizer postprocessor offers a streamlined and efficient approach to postprocessing. This file contains the necessary configurations and optimizations that make the NC Optimizer technology so powerful.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Enhanced-Access-to-Information-with-NC-Optimizer,Enhanced Access to Information with NC Optimizer,"Traditionally, postprocess have translated tool path events into NC lines event by event, limiting access to crucial information until specific events occur. However, with the introduction of MOM extensions, the NC Optimizer brings a paradigm shift by granting early access to a wealth of information at the beginning of the postprocessing run.The NC Optimizer unlocks the ability to access the following information at the start of the postprocess run:Operation's Tool Path Type:This includes valuable details about the tool path type, allowing for better analysis and optimization. Additionally, information about the operation's initial tool axis vector is now available from the outset.Group Hierarchy Info:Gain insights into the hierarchical structure of groups, enabling more efficient organization and processing of tool paths.Tool Info:Access comprehensive information about the tools utilized in the machining process, facilitating better tool management and optimization.Operation Setting Info:Obtain essential details about the specific settings applied to each operation, providing better control and customization options.MCS Info:Access information about the Machine Coordinate System (MCS), enabling accurate positioning and alignment of tool paths.UDE Info:Gain insights into User-Defined Events (UDEs), allowing for enhanced customization and integration of specific events into the postprocessing workflow.MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type: Enhancing Tool Path AnalysisThe MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type command is a powerful tool provided together with the NC Optimizer that allows you to retrieve the tool path type for a specific operation or optimized group. This command provides valuable insights into the characteristics of the tool path, enabling better analysis and optimization.Note:  It is available since NX2312, can be used in traditional postprocessor.Syntax:MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type <opr_name>Input:opr_name: Name of the operation or optimized group for which you want to retrieve the tool path type.Return:0: The command execution failed.1: The command executed successfully.Output:The MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type command provides two MOM variables as output:mom_sys_tool_path_type(opr_name):This variable contains the tool path type for the specified operation or optimized group. The possible values are:""NO_MOVE"": Indicates that there is no movement in the tool path.""NO_CUT"": Indicates that there is no cutting motion in the tool path.""FIXED_AXIS"": Indicates that the tool axis remains fixed throughout the cutting motions.""POSITIONING"": Indicates that the tool axis changes in the NCM but remains the same across all cutting motions.""MULTI_PLANES"": Indicates that the tool axis does not have continuous changes in the cutting motions.""SIMULTANEOUS"": Indicates that there are simultaneous tool motions in the tool path.mom_init_tool_axis:This variable contains the tool axis vector of the first motion in the specified operation. It provides valuable information about the initial tool axis orientation.Calculation Tolerance in MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type:In MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type, the calculation tolerance is determined using the vector distance calculated with mom_kin_4th_axis_min_incr. This tolerance calculation method provides a more accurate and precise representation of the machine's capabilities, particularly with respect to the 4th axis.The mom_kin_4th_axis_min_incr parameter represents the minimum increment for the 4th axis rotation. By using the radian value of this parameter, MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type calculates the vector distance tolerance. This tolerance value is then utilized in the tool path analysis and optimization process.MOM_ask_group_info: Retrieving Group Hierarchy InformationThe MOM_ask_group_info command, available since NX2312, is a valuable tool provided by the NC Optimizer that allows you to obtain group information from different CAM setup views (program, machine tool, geometry, method) for a given operation or group name.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Tool-Path-Type-Changes-with-NC-Optimizer,Tool Path Type Changes with NC Optimizer,"When dealing with a multi-axis machine, it is crucial to determine the tool path type and adjust the output mode accordingly during postprocessing. In addition to using the MOM_ask_oper_tool_path_type MOM extension, our NC optimizer offers two events that can be used to indicate any changes in the tool path type and how it should be handled.Event: MOM_tool_path_type_changeThe MOM_tool_path_type_change event is used to indicate when and how the tool path type changes during postprocessing, particularly for multi-axis machines. This event contains the following variables:- mom_prev_tool_path_axis_mode: Represents the previous tool path axis mode. It indicates whether the tool path axis was in VARIABLE or FIXED mode before the change.- mom_tool_path_axis_mode: Represents the current tool path axis mode. It indicates whether the tool path axis is in VARIABLE or FIXED mode after the change.- mom_tool_path_axis: Represents the current tool path axis. It provides information about the axis or axes along which the tool path is defined.- mom_prev_tool_path_axis: Represents the previous tool path axis. It provides information about the axis or axes along which the tool path was defined before the change.By monitoring the MOM_tool_path_type_change event and accessing these variables, you can react and adapt your postprocessing output mode based on the tool path type changes. This allows you to customize the output and optimize the machining process for multi-axis machines.Event: MOM_machine_motion_markerThe MOM_machine_motion_marker event is used to indicate the start and end of traverse motion in multi-plane operations, such as hole-making operations, where the tool axis changes from one feature to another feature. This event contains the following variables:- mom_traverse_clearance_geometry_type: Represents the type of geometry used for traverse clearance. It provides information about the geometry type, such as a clearance plane or a clearance surface.- mom_start_machine_tool_axis: Represents the machine tool axis at the start of the traverse motion.- mom_start_machine_pos: Represents the machine position at the start of the traverse motion.- mom_start_machine_mcs_goto: Represents the machine coordinate system (MCS) at the start of the traverse motion.- mom_is_machine_motion_start_marker: Indicates whether the event is a machine motion start marker.- mom_end_machine_pos: Represents the machine position at the end of the traverse motion.- mom_end_machine_mcs_goto: Represents the machine coordinate system (MCS) at the end of the traverse motion.- mom_end_machine_tool_axis: Represents the machine tool axis at the end of the traverse motion.By utilizing the MOM_machine_motion_marker event and accessing these variables, you can identify the start and end of traverse motions in multi-plane operations. This information allows you to handle tool axis changes effectively and optimize the postprocessing output accordingly.These events and variables provided by the NC Optimizer enhance the postprocessing workflow for multi-axis machines, enabling you to react and adapt to different tool path types and traverse motions.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Manufacturing-Resource-Library-for-Inspection,Manufacturing Resource Library for Inspection,"Simulation processes within NX require detailed preparation. This also includes the resources for carrying out a measurement process within NX Inspection.The Manufacturing Resource Library within Active Workspace helps to set up and manage these resources and enables them to be retrieved quickly and easily as required.This article shows how to prepare the individual components and explains how they interact.Starting with the overall picture of a measurement setup, which is explained in detail here and implemented in the following videos.To be able to use a coordinate measuring machine extensively, various mounting points must be defined. For this purpose, the holding system and the type of fixture are defined at the desired position on the machine model. These recordings can be used both statically and dynamically later in the measuring process.NX is not necessarily needed to set up a probing tool according to the necessary requirements, quickly.With Manufacturing Resource Library in Teamcenter, this task is simple and straightforward. The guided component search saves the user a lot of time and leads directly to the desired goal.For the probing tool to be used in an inspection process, the mount and the tracking points must be defined. Due to the variability of a measuring tool setup, this is done manually in NX. The steps required for this are defined in DIN 4000-178.Unlike machine tools, a tool rack for a coordinate measuring machine is not a fixed part of the set-up. Depending on the process, the tool rack is moved or replaced by another one.Preparation is therefore necessary for handling these devices. All steps are required once for each set-up and then allow the device to be used repeatedly.Due to the individual setups of probing tools shown in the overview, parts of a measuring system can be declared as devices if required.This allows interchangeable systems to be simulated and probes to be replaced during the measuring process without having to remove a measuring head from the machine quill, for example.If such a measuring head is to be used as a device, adjustments must be made once to the kinematic model.Finally, all prepared components are loaded, installed and their adaptivity demonstrated.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Commissioning-Manager-for-NX-CAM,Commissioning Manager for NX CAM,"Efficient tool data management is crucial in manufacturing. The new Commissioning Manager is specifically designed to streamline the handling of tool and device data sets. It is an innovative application aimed at enhancing the commissioning process on machines. Sometimes, commissioning sets do not accurately transfer to the NX CAM session, leading to time-consuming tasks like copying existing parts or tools between sessions.As NX CAM user, you can now save and restore specific tool sets directly from the library within the machine context, which streamlines the virtual commissioning process during CAM setup creation and optimizes tool position on the specified tool carrier. Key features include importing and exporting commissioning data sets, a user-friendly interface, and seamless integration into the digital part manufacturing process.Benefits of NX CAM Commissioning ManagerImproved Efficiency: Exchange tool data sets with one click.Enhanced Accuracy: Minimizes errors during manual commissioning interactions.Cost Savings: Optimizes tool order, reducing unnecessary waiting times.How to install NX CAM Commissioning Manager?Download the application folder from Post Hub, under the Support Resources section.https://posthub.sws.siemens.com/Refer to the NX CAM Commissioning Manager documentation PDF in the documentation folder for detailed information and step-by-step instructions on installing the application.Commissioning Manager workflowThe Commissioning Manager offers workflow options that include operations such as importing/exporting commissioning data sets, deleting tools and devices, updating tools from the library, exporting tools to library and rearranging tool positions. Let’s review them one by one:ImportBrowse to the folder containing all exported configurations. Use the ""Filter Compatible Set Files"" option to filter by the machine's library reference. Select the suitable configuration, and hit the Import button to add the configuration to the current CAM setup.ExportTo streamline sharing and collaboration, export the current configuration. Click the ‘Export’ button, choose a directory, and provide an appropriate file name. The data, saved in JSON format, will include details such as the creation date, machine library reference, tools library reference, and mounting information. If applicable, it will also cover similar details for devices.Delete tools and devicesWith one click, the “Delete tools” option present under Other tab deletes all tools from the current setup and moves all associated operations to Unused Items. Similarly the Delete Tools option  deletes all Devices from current setup.Unmount ToolsWith the unmount tool option you can move all the tools to unused items.Update Tools from Library and Export Tools to LibraryWith one click, you can update all tools from the library. This is helpful if you have made changes to the tools and want to incorporate the latest versions into the current setup.Likewise using export tools to library option, you can export all tools from the current setup to the Tool Library, automatically creating a new library reference.OptimizationThe Optimize Tool Order option helps rearrange the tool positions in the selected tool carrier. This optimization is based on the usage of tools in the program order. It checks the tool usage from the program order and arranges the tools in the tool view accordingly.Note: Tool carriers with at least one tool are available for optimization.ControlsWith the ""Show Additional Output in Listing Window"" option, you can output additional information to the listing window during export/import or with other available options.Use the latest NX CAM Commissioning Manager application to efficiently manage tool data and enhance the commissioning process on machines, thus streamlining the virtual commissioning process during CAM setup creation.For any feedback you like to share you can use the integrated feedback button in the application or reach out to us directly onposthub.disw@siemens.com."

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/3D-Adaptive-Roughing-Toolpath-Start-and-Pre-Drill,3D Adaptive Roughing  - Toolpath Start and Pre-Drill,"The highly efficient 3D Adaptive Roughing operation in NX CAM has had two enhancements done.The first one is specifying toolpath start point. Often the default start point for the toolpath is not desirable because the tool may engage in a closed pocket instead of a simple open area.Sometimes the tool starts cutting at the back of the part instead of the front of part on the machine so the machine operator can ascertain the toolpath safety. To address this, users can now specify the point at which they would like the toolpath to start cutting.The second one is specifying pre-drill points. When cutting a pocket, the tool can start cutting with a helix or a ramp engage. This causes excessive tool wear as the tool goes down the helix and increases machining time as the feedrate on the helix is slower compared to cut feedrate.To improve this, the pocket can be pre-drilled to its floor and the tool can be made to plunge without helixing to the cutting level before it starts cutting. This saves tool life and reduces overall machining time.Created with NX CAM 2406Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Content-on-Post-Hub-for-NX-CAM-On-Machine-Probing,Content on Post Hub for NX CAM On-Machine Probing,"In existing customer solutions using NX CAM, an out-of-date legacy post-processor solution has often been used to output NC code. This solution has served its purpose but is now considered outdated compared to the more advanced capabilities offered by Post Configurator, the current postprocessor technology in NX CAM.To provide customers with a smooth transition, a Post Processor add-on has been developed for both Post Builder and TCL-based solutions. This add-on acts as a bridge, allowing users to continue using their familiar environment while gradually migrating to the upgraded Post Configurator.However, it's important to note that while the Post Processor add-on provides compatibility with legacy systems, future development and enhancements will be focused solely on the Post Configurator. As such, customers are strongly encouraged to migrate to Post Configurator to take advantage of the full range of new post-processing features and capabilities.This transition not only ensures access to the latest enhancements, but also guarantees long-term support and compatibility with future versions of NX CAM.Created with NX CAM 2406Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/NX-CAM-Power-Naming-Renaming-machining-operations-simplified,NX CAM Power Naming: Renaming machining operations simplified,"Renaming a machining operation can be challenging if it is done manually. It becomes even more difficult when there are multiple operations or if you modify an operation; it is practically impossible to go to the operation navigator and right-click on every operation to rename it manually based on changes in the tool name, tool number, tool description, operation type and follow a naming convention.However, with NX CAM Power Naming, you don't have to worry about this. Renaming operations is made simpler than ever with just few clicks, saving valuable time and manual effort.NX CAM Power Naming is an innovative application designed for NX CAM users who want to streamline their workflow and enhance productivity. Create and save custom rules for operation names. Whether you prefer sequential numbering, descriptive tags, or specific prefixes, the app adapts to your preferences.Streamline your workflow and become a productive CAM programmer. Download the application from Post Hub. Available now!How to Install NX CAM Power naming?Download the NX CAM Power Naming application from the Support Resources section of the Post Hub athttps://posthub.sws.siemens.com/. Once downloaded, unzip the folder located in your default Downloads directory. Within the unzipped folder, navigate to NX_CAM_Commissioning_Manager > App.Refer to the NX CAM Power Naming documentation PDF in the documentation folder for detailed information and step-by-step instructions on installing the application.NX CAM Power Naming workflowThe workflow begins with creating a new rule for naming a machining operation. Rules define the sequence of naming an operation. You can create a new rule or use a pre-created rule.When you run the Power Naming application, you will see two operations: Rename and Rules Operation. You can manage rules for creating, deleting, and duplicating. Specify the Rule Name and then define the Separator; the supported separators are ""_"" (Underscore) and ""-"" (Hyphen).You can also delete existing rules and duplicate them to maintain version control. Select the rule items such as cut depth, date, fixture offset, floor stock, method name, operation type, stock, tool name, tool number, user input, and wall stock. Users can input as many items as needed.The next step is to define the Rule item properties. Using Rule item properties, define the prefix and suffix for each respective rule item. In the case of ""User Input"", you can define the string that should be included in the Operation Name.Once the rule is finalized, hit the Save button to save this rule. You can now use this rule from the Rename tab and Rule Name drop-down menu. Hit the Rename button to apply the rule in the current CAM setup.Take advantage of the latest NX CAM Power Naming application and effortlessly rename machining operations, saving valuable time and reducing manual effort.For any feedback you like to share you can use the integrated feedback button in the application or reach out to us directly onposthub.disw@siemens.com."

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Feature-Based-Machining-Configurator-in-NX-CAM,Feature Based Machining Configurator in NX CAM,"Feature Based Machining(FBM) is used to automatically create operations to machine prismatic parts with many features, such as pockets, holes and slots.FBM Configuratoris the authoring tool that replaced the Machining Knowledge Editor (MKE) in release NX 2212.It is launched from the Ribbon:Further below you'll find 7 videos that takes you through different scenarios, to easier get you familiar with FBM Configurator and begin using Feature Based Machining.The NX CAM installation comes with 2 example knowledge files containing the same rules. The difference is the tool library classification: One using the native ascii library, the other Teamcenter MRL.The purpose of these OOTB knowledge files is twofold:Demonstration of the capabilitiesProvide an example machining knowledge for learningTo meet the exact needs for your company you may have to adapt to one or more of the following:Customized tool classification in your libraryCustomized operation templates for your CAM usersCustom User Defined EventsCustom manufacturing feature types or attributes for your typical partsSpecific sequences of operations based on varying inputs like size, machine tool, workpiece material and tolerances (PMI dimensions and surface roughness) to be achieved.The FBM Configurator is the authoring tool that can create, change, save and delete rules. The machining knowledge is shared by all CAM users in your company. Not all CAM users need to be FBM authors.Computer Aided Process PlanningManufacturing Features are the link between Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) and are the enablers of Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP).When we define a machining rule, we create a relation between the feature geometry to be machined, the tool to be used, and the operation, as depicted in the triangle below. In essence it is like interactively programming in NX CAM where you are supported by a Geometry View, a Machine/Tool View, and a Program Order/Method view.Once a Machining Rule is defined, you can further specify the details. Most important are the rule conditions.You will be prompted to define 4 different categories of conditions:Application criteria, where you use only the parameters of the Feature geometry to be machinedTool attributes, where you define the tool query using the parameters of the Feature geometry to be machined and the parameters of the toolLess Worked Feature attributes that define the geometry transformationOperation attributes that further detail the operationWorking with FBM ConfiguratorWe have created a series of videos that take you through programming machining rules step by step, from scratch.The target is to completely machine a simple plate as shown here. Of course, your machining rules can be used on any other CAD model having similar features:Your knowledge applies to Machining Features that can occur in any part. The part and blank geometry that was used in these videos can be foundhere, or in UGII_CAM_BASE_DIR\samples\try_nx_cam\3-Feature-Based-Machining.Episode 1: Drilling a holeWe start with what is perhaps the most trivial of all:Drilling a hole using a twist drill.Watchthis video tech tipand try it yourself. We build on this in the next episodes.The tool selection condition that we entered results in a twist drill with a diameter equal to the recognized hole.Alternatively, we can specify a bandwidth for the tool diameter. For instance:tool.'(D) Diameter'<=mwf.DIAMETER_1Since the system will try to use the largest tool that satisfies the condition, this may result in a tool that does not drill to the full diameter. You can have a look in the OOTB machining rules for Twist Drills and see how diameter tolerances are used to select the right tool.Machining Rule “Drill a first hole” is made valid for through holes with a diameter smaller than or equal to 12 mm. This explains why not all the holes in the plate are ‘solved’ yet. We need more know-how to also machine the larger holes, which will be the done in the next video.Episode 2: Drill to enlarge a holeThe difference with the already existing rule to drill a hole is the start geometry that is assumed to already exist, also called the Blank End or less worked feature (lwf).We assign a pre-drill diameter that can be drilled at once:lwf.DIAMETER_1<=12Watchthis video tech tipand try it yourself. We build on this in the next episodes.You can now have a look in the standard machining rules for Twist Drills and see how the pre-drill diameter is any value between 20% and 65%. See for instance machining rule Drill_up_S1H:lwf.DIAMETER_1>=mwf.DIAMETER_1*0.2lwf.DIAMETER_1<=mwf.DIAMETER_1*0.65Episode 3: Use a constant instead of a hard coded valueIn this episode, you will replace the hard coded value for 12 mm by a constant which may vary for any combination of machine tool and workpiece material.By default, the value is 12 mm and 0.5 inch.We do not add new machining knowledge in here but merely program in a more readable and consistent fashion.Watchthis video tech tipand try it yourself. We build on this in the next episodes.Episode 4: Mill a Counterbore into an existing through holeNow that we have some basic rules for machining Through Holes, you will create a machining rule that produces a Counter Bore Through Hole. Note that we take advantage of the existing knowledge for Through Holes. All we must do, is add one rule: we do not have to duplicate any knowledge.This rule asks for an end-mill with a diameter that easily fits in the already existing hole:tool.'(D) Diameter'<=mwf.DIAMETER_2 * 0.8Watchthis video tech tipand try it yourself. We build on this in the next episodes.At this point, you already have gained the necessary understanding ofhow create feature process works.Episode 5: Milling Open PocketsNext you will define a rough mill rule that can be applied to the 3 features in the plate that are recognized as ‘Slot Partial Rectangular’.When testing the rule in the plate, it appears that the default parameter settings of the Floor Wall operation must be overridden to another value in the machining rule conditions to obtain an optimal tool path. To get the desired non-cutting moves, you define a so-called Add-on to the machining rule.Watchthis video tech tipand try it yourself. We build on this in the next episodes.Episode 6: Machining Rule PrioritiesIn this episode, you create a second, competing machining rule for the Counter Bore Through Hole and give it a high priority value. The rule with the highest priority value is tried first duringCreate Feature Process. If the rule cannot be applied, for instance due to a missing tool, the next rule is tried.The higher priority rule uses a tool of class Counterbore. The rule asks for a tool with a pilot diameter that fits into the already existing hole:tool.'(D) Diameter' = mwf.DIAMETER_1tool.'(PD) Pilot Diameter' < mwf.DIAMETER_2Watchthis video tech tipand try it yourself. We build on this in the next episodes.Episode 7: Mill a planar surfaceFirst, we do some housekeeping. Having one library with all machining rules is a possibility, but we can apply any kind of organization as we like.The definition of a rule using Face Mill Midpass will by now be familiar. The conditions that detail the rule are “just” examples. These represent the actual know-how from the machinists in your company.In this example you will assign a Program Order Group parent name to the operation. When this parent exists in your cam setup, the operation will be allocated there. If not, the group will be created.Not all operation types in NX CAM can be a direct child of a Feature Group. The command “Check Validity” will report such situations and tell you to define a GeometryParent as a rule Add-on.You will create a 2nd, competing rule for machining a planar surface, now using the Floor Facing subtype. This is another example of using rule priorities together with application conditions and tool selection criteria.Watchthis video tech tipand try it yourself.ConclusionYou have finished implementing the rules as described in the videos and gained a good understanding of automated Feature Based Machining. You also learned that a handful generic rules can automate the process planning of a range of parts having similar manufacturing features, also demonstrated inAutomated mold plate machining with NX CAM.ResourcesCreated with NX CAM 2306Technical documentation for Feature Based Machining can be foundhere.​​Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

The programmer creates 3-axis tool paths and then tilt tool axis looks for potential collisions. When a potential collision is anticipated, the tool axis is gradually tilted away from the collision area, resulting in a 5-axis tool path that takes advantage of the short tool resulting in improved tool life and surface finish.Learn from Carson Huber, Advanced Application Engineer at Siemens, how NX CAM can support users creating more stable machining conditions on near-vertical geometry with the Tilt Tool Axis functionality.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Which-operation-is-better-to-use-in-a-Roughing-process-Cavity-Mill-or-3D-Adaptive-Milling,Which operation is better to use in a Roughing process? Cavity Mill or 3D Adaptive Milling.,"A customer recently asked ""Which operation is better to use in a Roughing process? Cavity Mill or 3D Adaptive Milling""The answer provided was:Cavity MillCavity Mill is an Offset Roughing Operation. The offset toolpath doesn’t guarantee constant chip thickness or cutting conditions during the cutting. Hence the cutter can embed into the stock beyond safety and risk tool life. To keep the machining process safe Feeds & Speeds have to adjusted.3D Adaptive Roughing3D Adaptive Roughing operation maintains constant cutter engagement or chip thickness due to which extra tool embedding is avoided and improves the machining process with constant cutting feed rate. Also used as a part of High Speed Machining Strategy.Both operations support generally similar type of tools such as Flat end mill, Bull nose, Chamfer tool, etc.A couple of distinct uses cases are slots and concave corners to highlight differences in the cutting method for both operations.Concave Corners:Offset Roughing/Cavity Mill:When cutting concave corners like below with Offset Path the tool can embed too much in the stock material which can risk the tool and workpiece and hence not productive.Offset Roughing PathTool Embedding into Concave CornerAdaptive Roughing: When cutting concave corners with Adaptive Pattern the minimum curvature radius can be assigned to the toolpath due to which the tool cuts with specified radius and maintains near constant cutting conditions and avoid tool embedding. This keeps the tool and workpiece safe and feed rate can be optimized appropriately.Adaptive PathEliminate tool embedding with constant engagement cutsMinimum Curvature Radius option to control cutting volumeSlots and Open Pockets:Offset Roughing:When cutting slots or open pockets with Offset Roughing, tool embedding cannot be avoided many times as shown below.Cavity Mill - Follow Part/Offset PathTool Embedding into slotAdaptive Roughing:When cutting slots and pockets with Adaptive Roughing, the Adaptive Pattern ensure that tool embedding does not happen as shown below.Adaptive PathNO Tool Embedding with Adaptive PatternBottom Up Cutting: In Adaptive Operation stock is machined near non-steep areas FIRST and then stock on the steep areas is cut with Bottom Up Cutting sequence upwards towards top of the stock. This allows cutting with most of the flute length when using long carbide end mills.Considering above general differencesCavity Millcan be safely used for material where tool embedding won't hurt the tool or workpiece. Or can be used anywhere in which the path doesn't cause tool embedding.Adaptiveis appropriate for hard materials like hardened steels, Inconel, Titanium, etc.. where tool embedding has to be eliminated for success. BUT can be used for any material, and situation depending on the use cases, available tools, hardware, equipment, know-how etc.Additional differences below:Cavity MillMachine specified areaFinish PassesDifferent PatternsFollow PartFollow PeripheryProfileZig ZagMany more..3D Adaptive RoughingThin Wall MachiningPillar CuttingMany more..Please see documentation links below for more informationCavity Mill:https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20220512394070742.mfgmilling/pcmill_cav_intro3D Adaptive Roughing:https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20220512394070742.mfgmilling/xid1978137Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

Then, we copy all 8 operations and adjust the machining areas where applicable. In the copied operation we change FACES_CYLINDER_1 to FACES_CYLINDER_3.In the second alternative, we recognize the hole geometry as 2 features, which are Threaded Counter Bore Through Hole.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Slot-Milling-using-Generic-Feature-Operation-in-NX-CAM,Slot Milling using Generic Feature Operation in NX CAM,"Generic feature operations allows users to define their own best practice operations based on feature parameters.This is useful in cases where regular operations either doesn't support the necessary workflow or the user requires specific controls over the machining operation to optimize process efficiency.Challenge:Reducing programming time on simple geometry saves both time and can also improve process efficiency. In the case of various Slot geometries, it may be sufficient to have a single cut down the center of the slot.Solution:With the Generic Feature Operation functionality users have the ability to define a set of user specific operations matching their best practices as a set of templates and use these operations like any other NX CAM operation.For example, a Slot Milling operation, where the user has the option to specify the number of cut levels or loop on each level means the first cut goes down the center, then clean up each side wall is an efficient method of cutting slots.With generic Feature operations the users can define this type of operation based on machining feature parameters, Tool Parameters and User Defined parameters. The operations can be used in a feature group with multiple features where the operation will connect the motions between the individual features using hole making non cutting moves.This example provides three different slot milling operations.POCKET_OBROUND_CURVED_STRAIGHT slots.This slotting operation machines POCKET_OBROUND_CURVED_STRAIGHT features, with an exact fit tool. You are able to specify the cut direction to either CLW or CCLW, and you can specify the number of cut levels. The options are added to the Main node in the operation dialog.SLOT_RECTANGULAR method 1This slotting operation machines SLOT_RECTANGULAR features, with an exact fit tool. You are able to switch the cut direction to so it machines from either the bottom or the top of the slot, and you can specify the number of cut levels. The options are added to the Main node in the operation dialog.SLOT_RECTANGULAR method 2This slotting operation machines SLOT_RECTANGULAR features, with a tool smaller than the slot. You are able to switch the cut direction to either Climb or Conventional cut, and you can specify the number of cut levels. The tool path will start by cutting down the center of the slot, then either cut the left then right wall, or right then left wall depending on the Climb / Conventional parameter.The options are added to the Main node in the operation dialog.The operations are using a set of parametric motions, which defines the sequence of moves within a feature, all of those parametric motions are found in the Strategy node in the operation dialogs. The user can use formulas to define the individual moves when creating a generic feature operation.Download the part file (NX2206) used, to see details of the operation and motions defined in the different SLOTTING operations.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Back-Counter-Bore-Milling-using-Generic-Feature-Operation-in-NX-CAM,Back Counter Bore Milling using Generic Feature Operation in NX CAM,"Generic feature operations allows users to define their own best practice operations based on feature parameters.This is useful in cases where regular operations either doesn't support the necessary workflow or the user requires specific controls over the machining operation to optimize process efficiency.Challenge:Reducing the number of machining setups saves both time and improves process efficiency, especially when only a few simple machining operations force a second time consuming setup. In these cases multiple features from different sides may require, and be the most efficient, to un-clamp the part and re-clamp in another direction and thereby have multiple setups. Other times it may happen you can machine the features within single setup, if you had operations with even more control over than the regular NX CAM operations provided out of the box.Part clippedSolution:With the Generic Feature Operation functionality users has the ability to define a set of user specific operations matching their best practices as a set of templates and use these operations like any other NX CAM operation.For example a Back Counter Bore Milling operation, which first offsets the insert milling tool to make sure the insert isn't colliding with the pre-drilled hole, moves through the hole, offsets back to the correct position and cuts the back counter hole, then proceeds to offset again to make room for a retract motion.The users can now define this type of operation based on machining feature parameters, Tool Parameters and User Defined parameters. The operations can be used in a feature group with multiple features where the operation will connect the motions between the individual features using hole making non cutting moves.The operation is using a set of parametric motions, which defines the sequence of moves within a feature. In each subop, the user can use formulas to define the moves. For example in the images below, you can see how feature and tool parameters can influence the insert tool offset.The “X offset” is defined based on the Diameter of the counter bore hole from the machining feature and the Tool Diameter, Tool Shank Diameter and the Angle of the insert from the tool.Part clippedDownload the part file (NX2206) used, to see details of the operation and motions defined in the BACK_COUNTER_BORE_MILLING operation.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Thread-Turning-in-NX-CAM,Thread Turning in NX CAM,"What if you could create a thread toolpath in as little as 2 mouse clicks? With the new Thread Turning operation you can.The new thread operation type available in the summer 2022 release has been enhanced with multiple features to  improve the usability and reduce programming time, simply by utilizing 3D model based thread data from CAD.Challenge:In the past, the user had to manually specify the thread parameters in the operation, independent of the modelled (symbolic or detailed) thread. This resulted in re-entering redundant information, and worst case the wrong thread specifications. In addition the postprocessor retrieved insufficient information from the tool path for cycle output, resulting in unnecessary and special logic in the post implementation.Solution:Several improvements have been made for lathe threading in NX CAM. The current Thread Turn operation is very powerful and gives the user the ability and flexibility to create turning tool paths for a wide range of threads.The latest enhancements were built on top of the existing operation, with a focus on ease-of-use and CAM automation.The new input modes require a minimum of user interaction and result in maximum benefits for CAM automation for the creation of thread toolpaths.The user needs to select input mode; Model Based, Table Based or Manual. Model or Table based input modes needs selection of a face on the cylinder. When the selected surface contains thread feature information, the Model Based input type retrieves the relevant thread feature information from the model, and adds those to the operation parameters to create a thread tool path.If the selected surface does not contain any thread feature information the user can pick Table Based. Then the system offers several thread size options, based on the diameter of the surface. The ""old"" Manual mode can still be used, to specify the thread operation manually.The underlaying post processor architecture (MOM) for turned threads has also been improved so that all relevant thread parameters are available to support common cycle outputs (e.g. CYCLE99/97). Note; Customizations in existing postprocessors will need to be updated to use the new MOM cycle architecture.Additionally, the operation now supports different infeed methods; radial, front/rear and incremental flank. The infeed method determines how the insert is applied to the workpiece to create the thread form, influencing chip control, quality of the thread, insert wear type and tool life.A few minor enhancements allowing the user easily reverse the cut direction and displaying the 'Handedness' is also implemented.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/U-Axis-Turning-support,U-Axis Turning support,"U-axis turning support allows for the usage of multiple turning spindle axes for U-axis turning, preventing the IPW from rotating during simulation when the tool is mounted to a device classified as a facing head.Video transcript:This new feature allows for the usage of multiple turning spindle axes for U-axis turning in NX CAM. As a result, it prevents the IPW from rotating during simulation when the tool is mounted to a device classified as a facing head, making programming and simulating facing heads much easier.In this example, the larger holes have been pre-milled, and the final cuts will be executed with a turning operation where the turning tool is mounted to a facing head.In the Geometry View, we have a Main MCS, which is normally the machine coordinate system.Under this, we have a single WORKPIECE component and underneath that, the first spindle MCS named SPINDLE_TOP_LEFT to machine the top left hole.For milling purposes, we have dedicated MCS’s to machine from the top and the front side.To perform facing head machining on the top left hole, we use the first spindle MCS.For the machining of the top right hole, we use the spindle MCS SPINDLE_TOP_RIGHT which is shifted over from the first spindle MCS.In a similar manner, we set up the spindle MCS’s for machining the front left hole and the front right hole.As you can see, the IPW in each turning operation is correctly updated and only the material remaining after milling is removed.In addition, material removal in all simulation types – namely Toolpath Animation with IPW, Verify -> 3D and Simulate, is applied correctly and the IPW is not rotated as the turning tool is mounted to a facing head.With this new functionality, programming and simulating facing heads is now much easier.Created with NX CAM 2206Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

Tooltip pictures further assist you in understanding how clockwise and counterclockwise are defined. This is the turning direction that will be output in the Post.Now we’ll postprocess and see how the output spindle direction matches what we specified.Existing postprocessors will work as before.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Tool-Creation-and-Usage-Improvements,Tool Creation and Usage Improvements,"Multiple enhancements have been made to tool handling in the context of the machine tool, reducing manual interaction and making tool handling easier and more intuitive.Video transcript:Multiple enhancements have been made to tool handling in the context of the machine tool, reducing manual interaction and making tool handling easier and more intuitive. These enhancements include:Simplifying the 3D Assembly Tool creation workflowAllowing changes on origin tool parameters onlyOverall improved usability of tools in the machine contextand Adding a Quick Open option for the Tool, Device, and Machine ToolThere are 2 main stages when applying tools in NX CAM:Tool Definition, where you create the parametric or 3D assembly toolAnd Tool Usage where youusethe tool within the CAM Setup orcreatea parametric tool within the setupThis video will step you through the workflow of both tool definition and usage.In this example, the displayed tool is a generic assembly from a tool vendor which we wish to prepare and export to the NX CAM tool library for later reuse in a cam setup.It has been oriented correctly in the world coordinate system and the WCS has been specified as the tool center point position.Tool DefinitionWe’ll begin by selecting Create Tool.The best practice library turning tool creation resource on Posthub (https://posthub.sws.siemens.com/#/mats) contains two templates. These templates support the user when creating solid or parametric turning tools for the library.  The templates are available for standard tools only. Templates for grooving or threading tools are not yet available.In this case, we’ll create a 3D solid assembly tool.The new tool definition dialog displays.The tree on the left guides you through the process of creating a tool as you work from top to bottom.We’ll start by specifying the tool parameters for a 3D button tool. In this case, we’ll select the Round insert and adjust the dimensions.We’ll specify the setup information by defining the Junctions for the Mounting and Tool Tip as well as specifying the Cutting Portion of the tool.You can also specify a color for the tool if necessary and Compensation settings to determine the tracking point.Control options determine the tool number, manual change, and limits.Lastly, we’ll enter a library reference and export the tool to the NX CAM tool library.The system notifies you when the tool has been successfully exported to the library.Tool UsageNow we’ll see what has improved when the tool is used in the setup.When editing the assembly tool from the library, notice that most of the tool parameters are greyed out. Only the original tool part file should be edited.  The tool cannot and should not be edited from within the setup.The Export option has been removed because tools should only be exported separately. This avoids miscreation of library tools.Parameters without library references may be customized.TheNewOpen in Window option is a convenient way to quickly open assembly objects in cam. It is available for Tool Assemblies, Device Assemblies and Machine Assemblies.Using theNewQuick Open option opens the underlying assembly part file quickly, eliminating the need to manually search for the component in the assembly navigator or for the tool in the Assembly Navigator Tree or on the disk.ANewmessage displays when a parameter is changed, alerting you that the change will break the link to the tool library.In cases where you do not have access to the original tool part file, moving the tool to Unused Items will unlock the tool parameters, allowing you to change the original tool parameters but resulting in a broken library link.The same message is displayed as before.The parametric representation is still available, but with no link to the library.Additional improvements have been made to make the positioning of parametric tools more user friendly and intuitive.First, parametric tools are displayed in their mounting position when displaying the tool edit dialog.Second, adjusting the XY Mounting Position will display the position immediately.And third the mounting junction of a parametric tool is now shown, displaying a reference of the XY mounting values.Created with NX CAM 2206Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

The X’s indicate there is currently no machine code available in the operations.We’ll begin by Post Processing the program.Notice that processing time is required as the machine code is postprocessed for each operation. The machine code is stored in each operation as indicated by the green checkmarks.We’ll postprocess the same program again, making no changes to setup or the post processor and see how detecting the unchanged machine code avoids redundant processing time.The Post Process Dialog is different because the system detects the unchanged machine code.Because the machine code has not changed, the postprocessor is not executed, resulting in a significant performance improvement.If the machine code changes in any way, the system detects it, automatically invalidates the stored code, and executes the postprocessor.Here, for example the operation is edited and the Machine Code icon for that operation shows a broken link, indicating that the machine code is no longer valid.The change requires the operation to be postprocessed.Detecting the unchanged machine code also improves performance for repeated Machine Code Simulation runs. As before, new or edited machine code must be postprocessed.Check marks appear in the Machine Code column as the machine code is postprocessed and stored in each operation.For subsequent Machine Code Based Simulations, the system recognizes machine code that has not changed and avoids redundant postprocessing.Tool path events with the corresponding machine code can be displayed via the Tool Path Report.Created with NX CAM 2206Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Multi-Channel-Robots,Multi-Channel Robots,"NX CAM now supports multi-channel robots for Sinumerik controllers.Video transcript:This new feature supports multi-channel robots for Sinumerik controllers. In this example we’ll show how Machine Code Simulation can execute channels simultaneously for two robots on rails. We’ll also show how to add synchronization marks.The Machine Tool View of the Operation Navigator is where we pair the tool with the device and the device with the robot.Tools and devices have a customizable item to specify the target pocket. When there are two robots, we use this item to specify which tool or device goes with which robot.You can now see the target pocket is set to As Mounted. This makes sense because the tool has already been mounted to the quill so it doesn’t need to be changed during the simulation.Now let’s look at the quill itself.You can see the quill will be mounted in POCKET_2 which is the flange on Robot 2. Note that the channel is assigned.One Sinumerik controller will run both robots. Sinumerik is a good choice of controller because it can handle 30 axes including two robots.Tool Path Animation with a Tool Assembly will move the robot with the tool.First, robot 1 moves and then robot 2 moves. The robot display is not synchronized.Now let’s look atTool Path Based Simulation.Again, robot 1 moves first followed by robot 2. The robot display is not synchronized.ForMachine Code Based Simulation, both channels execute simultaneously.The system must run the entire postprocessor up front before simulation wil l begin.You can display an Execution View for each robot.You can now see both robots play simultaneously and are synchronized.Next, we’ll add synchronization marks.NX must run the postprocessor and machine code simulation for each robot up front so it can determine the relative times between them to attain a synchronized tool path.The Synchronization Manager dialog box appears showing both channels.What we see here is the same as what we saw for Machine Code simulation. Both robots play simultaneously and are synchronized.We’ll now add a synchronization mark so that the first robot will wait for the slower second robot.Both channels will be affected as shown by the check boxes.Now we have a Sync mark.Dragging the sync mark for the first channel to the beginning will cause the first robot to wait at that mark until the second robot gets to that point.We’ll need to recalculate the times.Again, NX must run the postprocessor and machine code simulation for each robot.Notice that robot 1 now waits for robot 2. When the synchronization mark is hit by robot 2, robot 1 will continue.Created with NX CAM 2206Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

There are four main types of barrel tool:Standard form barrel toolTaper form barrel toolTangential form barrel toolLens toolWhat are the benefits to using Barrel Tools?Depending on the application, barrel radii upwards of 1000mm are possible. Much larger stepovers are made possible, therefore reducing cycle time.Longer cut area to spread tool wear.What features are Barrel Tools best suited to?Finishing of straight and curved surfaces (walls, floors).Blade machining.Anywhere that the part geometry will allow.Are they difficult to apply?NX CAM have made it much easier in recent years.Take more planning / input than regular ball mill cycles.Requires simultaneous 5-axis capable machines to operate to full capabilities.Can be limited by access / type of surface.Implement in NX CAMIn more recent versions, barrel tool definition has been simplified with the addition of the barrel tool subtypes:BarrelTangent BarrelTaper BarrelIf we look a typical pocket feature which is found in aerospace structural components:Material: Ti6Al4VPocket DimensionsFillet radii:                3mmCorner radii:            13mmDepth:                      29mmWall Thickness:       3mmSurface Curvature80mm x 300mmDue to the curvature of the surface adjacent to the outside wall, it is necessary to zig zag across this area of the internal wall, including corner rads.PreparationUsing a Ø16mm R3 solid endmill, the pocket is roughed using an adaptive milling strategy, stepping up the curved surface to rough closer to form.The vertical walls and fillets around the pocket can then be finished using the same tool, leaving just the swept surfaces to finish:Barrel Tool DefinitionBarrel tool definition is governed by the surface(s) to machine.  The minimum radius of the surface to machine is 80mm so the barrel radius must be smaller.The type of barrel tool selected for this application is the taper barrel style tool. This gives good control of the tool vector relative to the surface and keeps contact away from the shank.Barrel Mill Tool PathWith no additional surfaces or modelling, we can use the Variable Streamline operation to create the toolpaths.Including the vertical walls gives control of the blend between tools using the trim / extend parametersSetting just a few parameters will give the desired tool path:Drive curves:Cut direction:Trim and extend values:Depth of cut:Projection vector:Tool axis:Tool VectorFor increased control of tool wear, it is possible to interpolate vectors to shift contact point on the tool on each pass:Cutting Parameters / TimeAssuming a value of 0.025mm for the max cusp height, the calculated step down is 3.16mm per pass.Other arbitrary cutting data:Vc          90m/minFz           0.05mmRPM       2387Vf           716mm/minComparable Ball Nose TimeUsing the same cycle with a Ø12mm ball nose we can compare the cut time. All parameters are set the same where possible.For the 0.025mm max cusp height, the calculated step down is 1.09mm per passNote, an additional tool would also be needed to reach the fillet.External SurfaceThe same tool and strategies could also be applied to the outside surface; however, it may not be the most productive or cost-effective solution:Barrel Tool:Sturtz Milling:The Sturtz option in this case is more productive (bigger stepover, potentially more teeth) and a cheaper option (indexable inserts).SummaryVery effective in certain situations (more in some industries than others).Have been made much simpler to implement in CAM systems.Many cutting tool suppliers now offer as standard.The uses can be limited depending on the part geometry.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Flow-Milling,Flow Milling,"Flow Mill in NX CAM is an advanced finishing operation that replaces existing Flowcut operations. Reliability, accuracy and consistency have been improved.Video transcript:Reliability and consistency have been improved for Flowcut operations. With these improvements, Flowcutting now becomes known as Flow Milling.These improvements include:Better support for Bull nose Reference ToolsImproved arc fitting for Zlevel PatternsImproved Cut Area consistencyBetter Uncut Material FindingGreater accuracy with shallow features and sharp cornersand Reference Tool Cut Region Manager support of 3D regions only, which greatly improves performance when loading the saved region.When the Flow Milling early access feature is turned ON, old Flowcut operations are automatically migrated to the new Flow Milling.Previously, Flowcut was inconsistent in how it applied the cut area rules. Changing Find Corners would often have little or no impact on the toolpath.Flow Mill strictly enforces Cut Area rules.Note that the dialog boxes will be renamed to Flow Mill once the project is productionized.Within Cut Area requires both Reference Tool contact points to be touching the cut area. If not, the corner will not be cut. In this example, the non-steep region at the bottom of the part is not cut because the reference tool only has one contact point touching the cut area.Include Adjacent requires only 1 Reference Tool contact point to be touching the cut area. As a result, the non-steep region at the bottom of the part is cut.Previously, Flowcut had difficulty cutting features where the Reference Tool was nearly the same size or larger than the feature being cut, such as in the case of slots or narrow pockets.Flow Mill does a better job of cutting these areas. As long as the cutting tool is small enough to cut the feature, the feature will be cut correctly.Flow Mill is more accurate than Flowcut when cutting shallow features with acute corners.In this example, Flowcut misses one corner and truncates others.Flow Mill cuts all the corners accurately.Flowcut operations can be manually or automatically migrated to Flow Mill. This may be done for operations with or without generated toolpaths.To migrate manually, pick one or more Flowcut operations and click Object -> Migrate.The displayed information indicates the migration status for each operation.You must save the part to save the migration.Operations can be migrated automatically by turning on the following Customer Default. This is especially useful when you have many operations to migrate.Once you restart NX, Flowcut operations migrate automatically when you open any part.You can verify this by selecting the operations and clicking Migrate.The status for all operations reads “Already Migrated”Note that Flowcut Operations that have not been migrated cannot be copied.The following Flow Mill caveats should be noted:Maximum Concavity has been removed from the dialogCross-Cut pattern type is not supportedZlevel Cut Between option is not supportedFlow Mill works best with solid bodies. Results may be unstable when using sheet bodies for prismatic parts with vertical walls.Created with NX CAM 2007Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

In cases where only the part body is specified, it’s often easier to select only those few edges you wish to exclude from the entire part.We’ll begin by creating a  Planar Deburring operation with only the part specified and generate the tool path. Then we’ll exclude edges.Notice that the edges of all faces accessible by the tool are machined.Exclude Edges is New. Select the edges to exclude and Generate.The excluded edges are no longer machined.You can easily display the edges that have been excluded in any operation.Now we’ll look at a practical application of Exclude Edges.The chamfered edges for the rectangular pocket (A) are excluded. The angle of the chamfer measured from the horizontal face is 140.0 degrees which means the chamfer requires a 50 degree chamfer tool.The remaining chamfered edges (B) have an angle of 135.0 degrees, so they require a 45 degree chamfer tool.This operation uses a 45 degree chamfer mill, so it becomes necessary to cut all the 45 degree chamfers (B) while excluding the pocket (A) with the 40 degree chamfer.Note that Edge Tracking is enabledThis operation uses a 50 degree chamfer tool. No edges are excluded.Only the rectangular pocket with the 40 degree chamfer is cut, since Edge Tracking is enabled and all other chamfered edges were cut in the prior operation.Created with NX CAM 2007Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

This new operation type contains all relevant sub-operation types. To use a device, the operation must contain a tool tip junction.For this example, let’s assume that we want to add a tailstock device to our CAM setup and create a tool path using the new GENERIC_MOTION_DEVICE operation type.The first step is to add the device to our setup. We can do this in the usual way through the Create Tool dialog.Once this has been done, we can create a new operation under the device.In the operation, we can now create a sub-operation to first position the device slightly away from the part.Note that the Tool Tip Junction defined in the device will follow the tool path.The second step is to move the device to the desired position.After the operation has been generated, it can be validated using Toolpath Animation or Simulate.Created with NX CAM 2007Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

This will allow us to implement some unique features and at the same time update existing functionality.To activate this feature, turn On the Operation Navigator feature toggle. A session Restart is needed.Once you have restarted the session, you will see the new Operation Navigator. The Change View buttons are now shown inside the navigator window allowing them to move with the navigator and making it more convenient for the user. Two new buttons on the right allow you to create two Program Views side by side. This can be useful for multi-channel machining as they enable you to filter each view individually for each carrier.You can create, modify, and save column configurations. Using the right mouse button, you can see and select all the configurations you’ve set. The option at the bottom allows you to configure them or create new ones. The configurations shown in gray are the OOTB configurations. The others are user-created and can be edited. For example, the Times Only configuration will show only the columns that are time related. You can return to the default configuration easily by selecting it from the list. This can be done individually for each of the views.To create a new set, click Create New Set, type a name and click OK. You can select the columns you would like to see in the set.

You’ll want to choose the option that allows the robot to best access the tool path.To use this feature, select an operation and open the Robot Control Dialog.The Positioner options are new.We’ll start with the simplest mode; Constant Joint Value. This mode sets the positioner axes to fixed user-specified values.We’ll set the POSITIONER_A1_AXIS value to 45 degrees and the POSITIONER_A2_AXIS value to 30 degrees.The tool moves while the positioner is fixed at the specified axis values.Moving the sliders allows you to clearly see the axes you modified.You can also use the sliders to modify the positioner axis values.The Constant Tool Axis mode aligns the positioner to a specified fixed tool axis.Note the direction of the Target Tool Axis arrow.The positioner axis rotates to align with the specified Target Tool Axis.The tool moves to achieve the path coordinate, and the positioner axes rotate to keep the tool axis aligned with the specified target tool axis.You can use the slider to modify the positioner angle relative to the specified Target Tool Axis.Constant Tool Side moves the positioner to keep the tool on the same side of the part.Note the target tool side arrow points toward the robot. This will cause the tool to contact the part on the side closest to the root.The color of the robot arm indicates a J2 axis limit violation because the tool is too close to the robot.We’ll move the tool to the far side of the part to avoid the limit violation.Note the Target Tool Side arrow now points away from the robot.The tool contacts the part on the far side, eliminating the violation.Lastly, we’ll lock one positioner axis to a constant value while allowing the other axis to adjust for tool axis or tool side. Either positioner axis can be locked to a particular value. In this case, we’ll lock Axis 1 to 45 degrees.The tool moves along the far side of the part while positioner axis1 is locked at 45 degrees.Created with NX CAM 2007Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Robot-Merge-Path-Apply-Rules,Robot Merge Path Apply Rules,"MERGE_PATH is an object in the Program Order View of the Operation Navigator in NX CAM that assembles the paths of separate operations into a single smooth, continuous motion.Video transcript:MERGE_PATH is an object in the Program Order View of the Operation Navigator that assembles the paths of separate operations into a single smooth, continuous motion.The paths are assembled according to a rule specified in the MERGE_PATH object; either By Concatenation or By Contour Count.MERGE_PATH adds non-cutting moves between the assembled constituent operations.NX CAM robotics allows robotic rules to be applied to either the merge path, the constituent paths, or to a combination of the two.In this example the merge path does not contain a defined rule for the rail.Instead, each constituent operation contains separate rules.Constituent operations L1 through L6 share a rail position value of 850,whereas constituent operations R1 through R6 share a rail position value of 2700.Let's see how the robot behaves. Here, the robot moves along the merge path with the rail at 850 for L1 through L6 and 2700 for R1 through R6.Notice that the robot moves smoothly over the non-cutting moves, such as the movement between the two impellers.The rail rule is blended between L6 and R1, providing a smooth, continuous motion.You can apply robotic rules for each constituent operation individually and then apply the rules to the merge path itself so that the connecting non-cutting moves are also applied, or you can simply apply robotic rules to the merge path as demonstrated here.The system detects that the rules need to be applied to the constituent operations and then to the resulting merge path.If we reapply the rules without changing anything, the system is smart enough to avoid recalculating the rules.In this next example we'll show a merge path with a complex taping head.This head contains a pocket for the taping tool (shown in green), and two pockets that hold extruders.The MERGE_PATH object contains five operations.Here you can see the positioner rule is defined in the merge path, so all constituents share the same set of rules.In the Robot Control dialog we see how the taping tool can be adjusted by moving the TAPE_ROTARY slider.The value of this axis is controlled by the User Defined Event shown here.Next, we’ll select an extruding operation. The robot control dialog allows you to see the extension and retraction of the extruder tool.In the merge path the IPW represents the tape as it’s applied to the mandrel form. Applying rectangular tape to a complex form leaves gaps which need to be filled in by the extruder.Lastly, we can see the extruder filling in the gaps.Created with NX CAM 2007Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Guideline-for-using-Boring-and-other-adjustable-tools-in-the-Manufacturing-Resource-Library,Guideline for using Boring and other adjustable tools in the Manufacturing Resource Library,"This Tech Tip demonstrates the procedures for the data management system Teamcenter (TC) and the CAD/CAM system NX to better support adjustable boring tools.These modular tools offer the possibility to change their cutting diameter after being assembled.This functionality should be supported by the 3D models of these tools in NX and should be controllable by changing relevant attribute values of the TC Manufacturing Resource Library (MRL).For each classified tool from the MRL there are two 3D models in NX:The detailed 3D model (mostly provided by the tool manufacturer), which consists of the 3D data of the assembled components and is used for the simulation of material removal and collision control.The parametric model, which NX CAM generates from MRL attribute values and is used to calculate the tool path.After changing the tool diameter value in TC Resource Manager (RM), the two 3D models in NX should automatically adjust to the new value. The individual steps to enable such functionality are explained in this guideline.By default, only the diameter of the parametric model will be transferred to NX. The diameter of the detailed model will not change with it. The two models, when loaded from TC RM into the NX CAM session, would appear as shown below:Parametric Model (adjusted) I Detailed Model (not adjusted) I both models (superimposed)After implementing the changes according to the guideline, the Cutting Diameter of the Detailed and Parametric Model will be synchronized automatically:Hands-on DemoSave the attached part file to your local driver and follow the instructions in the PDF document.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

Today, NX CAM allows multiple ways to initialize NX CAM.What are the best practices and how are things working together?What is the advantage of using File > New with manufacturing templates compared to just jumping into NX CAM by changing the application?This documentation will give you a guide for the different possibilities and best practices.NOTE:The information in this documentation is verified with NX1926 and based on standard (OOTB) NX CAM.No SME (Single Machine Edition)The file names mentioned in the documentation are standard filenames (OOTB)INITIALIZING NX CAMAfter opening a CAD part, what is the recommended way to start NX CAM?Today, there are multiple ways to start NX CAM (Initializing NX).Traditionally many users just change the application to NX CAM and based on the default defined it will use a library configuration or directly use a template (for example mill_planar.prt, turning.prt etc.).The recommended process is not jumping directly into Manufacturing.Using File > New and selecting a manufacturing setup template is our best practice.The following process chart will explain the different methods.What’s going on behind the scenes if “File > New” is used?.pax File is used to Initializing NX CAMSetup Information shows the setup Information of the newly created NX CAM setup.It is important to understand where the shown Libref is coming from and what the advantage is of having it defined.Libref is created out of a combination defined inside the template.dat and ugs_manufacturing_templates.pax.Please Note:<Filename>Setup_Template to be used to initialize<Configuration>Define additional information like.dat,.opt, etc.<LibraryClassPath>Define Library Class out of template.datLibref for a new part is created using the following information (see also “What happens during the opening of an existing NX CAM part?” below):<Filename> + <LibraryClassPath> + unitsIf combination does not exist – no Libref is used (NX1926)If multiple combinations are valid inside template.dat, first one is usedTemplate to be used is based on Libreftemplate.dat is holding template and Libref combination.opt File named inside configuration is used if Libref is not found inside template.datWhat’s going on behind the scenes if the “traditional way” is used?Please note that by using a standard template to configure NX CAM:You don’t get a master model (all the CAM information is stored inside the CAD file)You don’t get a Libref inside your CAM setupKeep in mind that it is also possible to select thecam_libraryif your default is CAM General (standard template to configure NX CAM)If your default is Library Configuration, it directly jumps into Library Class Selection by changing into Manufacturing application.In both cases:Selected Libref is usedTemplate.dat defines possible templates and which setup template is used to initialize CAMIn both ways, by using “File > New” or changing directly into Manufacturing and selecting a Library Configuration, you get a master model with Libref defined!In conclusion, there is no big difference between the two library-based methods to create a CAM setup, but “File > New” is much simpler and is aligned with other NX applications like Drafting, Line Designer, Simulation, MCD etc.What happens during the opening of an existing NX CAM part?This heavily depends on whether a library configuration is used or not.The following chart will show the different processes behind the scenes:The advantage of using a library configuration and a CAM part having library information defined:It will always show the templates used to create the CAM Part.When programming a turning part, only these templates are shown.When programming a milling part, no turning is shown.WEDM is not shown inside a turning and milling part.It will always come up with the templates used during the first programming of the part.Additional Helpful InformationHow to get Libref inside a new NX CAM part: Here it is important to understand the process behind it. This Method is used on all library connections (tools, machine tools, fixtures etc).Please note that it is also possible to set NX CAM configuration inside roles.This overwrite the UGII_CAM_CONFIG settings.This is for native (non-Teamcenter) configuration:Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Program-two-sided-features-using-Feature-Based-Machining,Program two-sided features using Feature-Based Machining,"Sometimes it is desired to machine from one direction as much as possible. Like in this simple example, you may want to do both through holes and one of the counterbores from one direction, then machine the remaining counterbore from the opposite direction. In thevideo, you can see one way to do this.NX CAM’s Feature Recognition will find and identify counterbores like these as STEP2HOLE-type features.  The position and orientation of these manufacturing features are attributes of the feature. In the example, the single arrows that you see indicate the default machining direction. The +Z-axis of the feature’s coordinate system points in the opposite direction. The coordinate system position is the recognized position of the STEP2HOLE feature and the default start point of the drilling and milling cycles.The NX CAM Feature Based Machining operations offer the capability to control the machining direction per feature.Inside the operation’s Feature Geometry you can select the individual in-process features and pressReverse Direction. The resulting position is translated over a distance equal to the DEPTH attribute value of the recognized STEP2HOLE feature.There are several ways to automate this sort of cases when using theCreate Feature Processcommand. Some customization or user interaction is always necessary since by default the processes for both features will be identical and operate in opposite orientations.Watch the videoto learn how to manuallytagthe feature that must be machined in the opposite direction. The tagging adds an attribute to the feature. The default machining rules test this attribute to decide if the operations must be reversed.For more information about hole machining , you can visit the NX CAM online technical documentation:https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/product/209349590/doc/PL20191127135844554.xid615615/html/xid1684004Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Reduce-Operation-Sets-to-Teach-in-NX-CAM,Reduce Operation Sets to Teach in NX CAM,"NX CAM’s Feature Based Machining offers the ""Teach Operation Sets"" capability to store your best practice machining operations in a knowledge base. By teaching your best practices, you make them available for future re-use by yourself or colleagues at your company.When you start using the teaching capability, you may soon find that the number of variations you must teach becomes very large. In this Tech Tip, we explain how to reduce the number of Operation Sets to teach with NX CAM.A counterbored hole like the one shown below is recognized as a STEP2HOLE. That means it’s a through hole with 2 diameters. DIAMETER_1 is the larger and DIAMETER_2 is the smaller.The diameters are theessentialattributes of the feature.Additionally, there arenon-essentialattributes that describe the chamfers of the counterbore. NX CAM recognizes the STEP2HOLE also when it has no chamfers. A value DEPTH_TOP_CHAMFER = 0 indicates there is no top chamfer, and a value DEPTH_TOP_CHAMFER_2 = 0 means there is no top chamfer on the 2nddiameter.When you switchOntheDisplay Machining Areasin the navigator, you can discover how the different regions of the feature are named.In this example, we see 3 chamfers – 2 top and 1 bottom chamfer.NX CAM makes smart use of the existence and absence of a Machining Area.If you teach the operations for the variant with all chamfers, you can re-use that on all other STEP2HOLE features as well, no matter how many chamfers are modelled.Watch the videoto see how.Read the technical documentation pagefor more details.This tech tip was created by Reinier Capelle (reinier.capelle@siemens.com).Please leave your comments and questions below."

Since Multi-Blade Roughing does not support this pattern, we’ll use a Multi-Axis Roughing operation.Click onWatch Nowlink to view the five minute NX CAM tech tip video, ""Adaptive Roughing for Impellers""Watch now.Transcript of video:To contain the pattern, we’ll start by defining a local blank representing the material between 2 blades.In the Modeling application, we’ll revolve the face of a blade around the axis of the part to create a solid body between two blades.The span of the angle should be slightly less than the angle between the two blades so the blank geometry does not extend beyond the blades.We’ll move the top face up just beyond the top of the bladeand offset the inside face of the blank geometry to fill the gap between the blank and the part.When we attempt to create the Multi Axis Rouging operation, notice that defining the Drive Ceiling Geometry requires selection of a single face. Currently, four faces define the ceiling.To accommodate this requirement, we’ll create a single face between the two blades by revolving a curve.Using Curve on Surface, select the edge of the blade and specify points to create a curve on the faces.In the Modeling application, we’ll revolve the curve between to two blades to create a single face.Now we have a single face from which to define the Drive Ceiling Geometry.We can now create the Multi Axis Rouging operation.Specify the part and blank geometry as we did beforeand select a face on the part hub as the Drive Floor geometry.If the part hub is complex or extends to other instances of the impeller, select the bottom face of the blank.Make sure the material arrow points upward. If not, flip it.Select the single as the ceiling.Define the Cut Levels, Pattern Parameters, Cut Strategy and Generate the tool path.First the main level is cut followed by bottom-up cleanup passes ..Followed by the next level and so on to last cut level.Show 3D IPW gives a good visual representation of the remaining material.Analyzing the IPW indicated most of the tool path is in the good quality range.Excessive IPW remains in some areas because the tool axis for each cut level is perpendicular to the cut level itself. The tool cannot undercut to follow the blade while remaining perpendicular to the cut level, so material is left on the blade.Additional operations that use a ball nose tool and allow undercutting can remove this material."
https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Tube-Finish-for-Closed-Impeller,Tube Finish for Closed Impeller,"An NX CAM user generated a Tube Finish operation on one of the sections of a Closed Impeller, and got a very partial result.  We will explain why it happens and show the flow to fix it.Here is the path he got:The reason is that the path of tube operations is highly dependent on the Central Curve of the geometry. If the curve is not explicitly provided by the user – the software generates it using some logic tuned for circular Ports and inlets. To see the central Curve the system produces click this button:In the dialog – click the preview:As you can see, the curve that the system created is very partial.  A manual curve creation is needed here. An easy workflow is to1.  For two of the opposing faces generate iso-parametric curves such that one sits in the center of the face along the geometry:2. Create a Through Curves mesh between those:3. Again – create an iso-parametric curve, now in the center of the new mesh:4. Extend the curves from both sides:5. The length should be such that planes perpendicular to the Central curve will slice the entire part. It is allowed to stick out too much, but not too less.6. Using the curve you built - the toolpath is much better:7.  Check if the coverage from both sides overlaps. Use the Show Tool Center to disregard the differences in tool orientation. In this case - the coverage is not good. First thing is to check that the Clearances for tool components embedded in the path are minimal. Preferably 0. Here is how 1 mm of shank clearance is used by the system:8. This is not the problem here, so it seems that tool and part geometries do not match. Replacing the tool with a larger spherical mill (4.5mm) – provides a path fully covering the tube.  The overlapping region is not cut twice, but each orientation gradually flares out to provide perfect finish quality regardless of the variations in orientation and tool wear.This is not a “bullet proof” workflow that works on all cases, but it would work for many and provides a good starting point in case that the results are not as expected.  See the part file attached.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/Natural-Frequency-and-Resonance,Natural Frequency and Resonance,"Direct YouTube link:https://youtu.be/DyZFt3WQ3B8*** Free Webinar - Fundamentals of Modal Testing ***What is a natural frequency?  What is resonance?The definition of these items are:Natural Frequency: All physical structures have natural frequencies.These are the frequencies at which the structure will tend to vibrate when subjected to certain external forces. These frequencies are dependent on the way mass and stiffness are distributed within the structure.Resonance: Resonance is a phenomenon in which a dynamic force drives a structure to vibrate at its natural frequency. When a structure is in resonance, a small force can produce a large vibration response.What does this mean in practice? When a dynamic force is applied to a physical object, it will vibrate.  When a force is applied at the object’snatural frequency, it goes intoresonance, and a higher amplitude vibration response is created.This article describes natural frequency and resonance.  Contents include:1. Analogy and Introduction2. Single Degree of Freedom Example2.1 Amplitude Response2.2 Phase Response3. Damping4. Mode Shapes5. Mitigating the Effects of Resonance5.1 Mass and Stiffness Fixes5.2 Damping Fixes5.3 Tuned Absorber6. Examples of Resonance6.1 Broughton Bridge6.2 Flutter in Aircraft6.3 Beating Sound6.4 Opera Singer and Glass6.5 Brake Squeal6.6 Helmholtz Resonator Air Induction6.7 Machine Tool Chatter6.8 Part Inspection7.  Final Thoughts: Resonance1.  Analogy and IntroductionAn analogy with a guitar may help. Pluck a string on a guitar and it will make the same sound each time. That is the guitar string vibrating at its natural frequency! The natural frequency is a property of the object itself: it will always vibrate at the same frequency independent of how hard or where it is plucked.  A force had to be applied to cause the string to resonate and be heard.All physical objects have multiple natural frequencies and can resonate under the right conditions.  Sometimes the natural frequencies are excited by external forces acting on the object, which creates vibration.  These vibrations may be so small that they cannot be seen by the human eye.  Sometimes, they are quite large and easily observable as seen inFigure 1.Figure 1: Everyday objects, like structures holding street lights, can resonate.Resonance can cause discomfort (vibration in steering column caused by resonance) or be catastrophic (resonance in airplane wing leads to failure).2. Single Degree of Freedom ExampleA mass-spring-damper system is a simplified representation that is useful for understanding natural frequencies and resonant behavior in real world objects.This is referred to as a Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system, because it has only one natural frequency/mode of vibration.  A real world object has many natural frequencies.A diagram of a mass-spring-damper system is shown inFigure 2.Figure 2: Mass-spring-damper system.The system consists of:Mass (m)Stiffness (k)Damping (c)The natural frequency (wn) is defined byEquation 1.Equation 1: Natural frequency of mass-spring systemThe natural frequency is an inherent property of the object. There are only two ways in which the natural frequency can be changed: either change the mass, or change the stiffness.2.1 Amplitude ResponseA force (f) can be applied to the object and the frequency response in displacement (x) or acceleration (a), can be plotted as shown inFigure 3. This is called aFrequency Response Function (FRF).Figure 3: Left - Displacement response (compliance) graph of mass-spring-damper system due to force as function of frequency. Right – Acceleration response (accelerance) graph of same.The largest displacement/acceleration of the mass occurs at the system’s natural frequency. Other amplitude response observations include:Compliance plot - Below the resonant peak, the amplitude of the response is nearly constant, approximately 1/k. This comes from Hooke’s law where force equals the product of stiffness and displacement (f=kx). Below the resonant frequency, the response of the system can be said to be stiffness dominated.Accelerance plot - Above the resonant peak, the amplitude is nearly a constant value of 1/m (really -1/m if phase is accounted for) as shown inFigure 3. This behavior is due to Newton’s second law where force is the product of mass and acceleration (f=ma). Above the resonant frequency, the response of the system can be said to be dominated by the mass.Knowing about thesestiffness or mass regionscan be useful in reducing vibration levels away from the resonance.2.2 Phase ResponseApplying the force through a moving base, and observing the mass response, yields some interesting phase relationships as shown inFigure 4.Figure 4: SDOF system response below, at, and above natural frequency of system.The following can be observed:Below the natural frequency, the base and mass move together in phase.At the natural frequency, the base and mass move 90 degrees apart, which creates a kind of “bucking” motion causing the high levels of vibration.Above the resonant frequency, the base and mass move out of phase.Real world objects, from cars to airplanes to washing machines, can be thought of a collection of mass, stiffness, and damping elements.  They have many natural frequencies.  Finite element models, used in calculating natural frequencies virtually, use this approach.  The models consist of a collection of elements composed of mass (mass density) and stiffness (Young's modulus).3. DampingDamping is the way a system naturally dissipates energy. Think back to the guitar example: does the guitar string oscillate forever after it is plucked? No! Energy is dissipated in the form of friction and sound which causes the string to return to rest after it has been plucked.In the single degree of freedom example covered in the previous section, the mass-spring system (m and k) would stay in motion forever if there was no damper (c) present as shown inFigure 5.Figure 5: SDOF system with no dampling (left) continues to vibrate while SDOF system with damping (right) stops vibrating.he higher the damping, c, the sooner the response of the system decays to zero.  The system response amplitude at the resonant frequency is reduced by increased damping. At the resonant frequency, the response of the system can be said to be damping dominated.More information about damping, and how to calculate it, can be found in the Knowledge base article:How to determine damping from a FRF.4. Mode ShapesThe SDOF example system had one natural frequency. Structures in the real world are more complex, and have multiple degrees of freedom (MDOF). As a result, real world structures have many natural frequencies. The structure vibrates differently at each of these natural frequencies. How it moves at a particular frequency is called a mode shape.Two modes of an aircraft (selected from many modes) are shown inFigure 6.  Each mode shape is unique, with different parts of the aircraft participating in the mode.Figure 6: Left – Lower frequency global mode of aircraft, Right – Higher frequency local mode of aircraft tail.Why is it important to understand modes and mode shapes? Mode shapes give valuable insight into how a structure behaves when operating at its natural frequencies. The shape can show the engineer where to constrain/modify a structure to reduce the vibration response, or how to shift the natural frequency so it does not coincide with the frequency of an excitation.InFigure 6, for example, the tail wing mode (right side) would need to be modified to change the natural frequency.  Changing the nose of the aircraft would have no effect on the natural frequency.  The shape gives insight into how to tackle a dynamic issue.At higher frequencies, generally speaking, modes become local in natural, rather than global. In a global mode, the entire structure participates (mode shape on left in Figure 6), while in a local mode, only part of the structure participates (mode shape on right in Figure 6).It is also typical that mode shapes become more complex at higher natural frequencies as seen inFigure 7.Figure 7: Mode shape of a simply-supported beam becomes more complex at higher frequencies.The fact that modes become more complex and localized at higher frequencies has implications for structural dynamic simulations and tests.  Simulations require a finer mesh and more elements, increasing solution times.  Tests will require more locations to be measured on the structure.5. Mitigating the Effects of ResonanceKnowing how destructive mechanical resonance can be, what can be done to avoid it? Options include:mass/stiffness modificationsdamping changestuned absorbers5.1 Mass and Stiffness FixesTo avoid resonance, the forcing frequency applied to the structure should not be at or near a natural frequency.  If the forcing frequency cannot be changed, then the natural frequency of the structure needs to be modified. This can only be done by altering the mass or stiffness (seeEquation 1).The guitar is a good example of how changing the mass or stiffness of a system effects the natural frequency. The strings on a guitar have different thicknesses. The strings which produce lower notes are thicker (more mass) than those which produce higher notes (less mass). As the mass of a guitar string increases, the natural frequency decreases (Figure 8).Figure 8: Progressively thinner strings create higher frequency notes on a guitar.When tuning a guitar, pegs/knobs on the guitar are turned to tighten or loosen the strings.  Tightening a string increases the stiffness, raising the natural frequency.In a structure, increasing the stiffness to place the natural frequency above the forcing frequency helps reduce vibration.5.2 Damping fixesDamping can be added to reduce the severity of vibration when operating at or near a natural frequency. The plot below (Figure 9) shows the reduction in amplitude of the system response as damping increases.Figure 9: When damping is low (green), system amplitude response is high. When damping is high (red), system amplitude response is low.Damping treatments are often used to reduce vibration.  For example, many large bridges, such as London’s Millennium Bridge, feature fluid viscous dampers to control vibration (Figure 10).Figure 10: Fluid viscous dampers (right) are used to reduce unwanted vibration (left) on the Millennium Bridge.The Millennium Bridge was opened to the public on June 10, 2000.  Due to excessive vibration caused by pedestrian traffic, it was shutdown after two days, retrofit with 37 fluid viscous dampers, and re-opened on February 22, 2002.5.3 Tuned AbsorberA tuned mass-spring-damper system can be used to reduce the amplitude of vibration in a dynamic system. A tuned mass damper modification is created by adding an additional mass-spring system “tuned” to the natural frequency of an existing system (Figure 11).Figure 11: Left – Original system consisting of m1 and k1. Right – Original system with tuned absorber (m2, k2) applied.Applying a tuned absorber (m2, k2) to an existing system (m1, k1) has two effects as shown inFigure 12:At the original natural frequency of the original system, the additional tuned mass-spring-damper will vibrate, but the original system will not move.The original natural frequency is split into two.  One mode of vibration where the original and tuned system are in-phase, and one mode where the original and tuned systems are out of phase. The in-phase mode is at a lower frequency than the original system natural frequency, while the out-of-phase mode is a higher frequency that the original system natural frequency.Figure 12: Original system (m1, k1) response (red) is reduced to zero (green) by introducing tuned absorber (m2, k2). New system has two modes: one above original system natural frequency, and one below.The effects are only possible when the tuned absorber frequency is equal to the original system frequency.How does this reduce vibration?  Consider a vehicle body mode where the engine idle forces excite the bending resonance.  The bumper can be turned into tuned mass-spring system so it can vibrate and cancel the bending mode.  The bumper will vibrate at idle, but the body will not, reducing the vibration felt by the driver.  The newly created in-phase mode will not be excited, since it is below the idle vibration.  The out-of-phase mode, which is higher than the original frequency excited at idle, can be tuned to an engine speed that is not often used in operation.One of the benefits of a tuned absorber approach is the additional mass and stiffness changes to the structure can be minimal. In the vehicle bumper example, the mass of the bumper was already part of the structure.  Adding spring/stiffness elements to the bumper was a minimal change in the overall weight of the vehicle, which helps with fuel efficiency, etc.Tuned dynamic absorbers also are used to help reduce the swaying vibration in buildings. The Taipei 101 skyscraper contains the world's largest and heaviest tuned mass dampers, at 660 metric tons (730 short tons).  The damper is tuned to the swaying mode of the building (Figure 13).Figure 13: Tapei 101 skyscraper (left) and tuned absorber (right).The tuned absorber is viewable by the public on an indoor observation deck at the top of the skyscraper.  It cost an estimated $4 million to build.More about modifying stiffness/mass, adding damping, applying tuned absorbers to modal models in theModification Prediction knowledge base article.6. Examples of Resonance6.1 Broughton BridgeIn 1831, the Broughton suspension bridge in England (Figure 14) collapsed when a column of soldiers crossed the bridge marching in step.Figure 14: Broughton bridge in 1883.The bridge had a natural frequency near the frequency of the marching of the soldiers and began to vibrate violently. This caused a bolt in one of the supporting chains to fail which led to the collapse of the bridge.6.2 Flutter in AircraftThe flight envelope (Mach speed and altitude) of any aircraft is determined by the resonant frequencies of the wings and airframe structure.  If the aircraft goes too fast, the aerodynamic forces can excite the natural frequencies causing a resonance, which in an aircraft is called flutter (Figure 15).Figure 15: In aircraft, flutter occurs when aerodynamic forces excite modes of the airframe.For more information read theGround Vibration Testing and Flutter Analysisknowledge base article.6.3 Beating SoundRolled the rear windows down while driving and heard a beating sound? That beating sound (sometimes also called buffeting) is amplified by a resonance of the vehicle air cavity (Figure 16).  Even air can have a resonance!Figure 16: Experimentally measured acoustic mode of vehicle air cavity.The air cavity inside the vehicle is trapped in a specific volume/geometry.  As a result, the air cavity has natural frequencies which can be excited and cause increases in the sound level in the car.6.4 Opera Singer and GlassA popular example of resonance from movies has an opera singer hitting a specific note, causing glasses in the audience to shatter (Figure 17), due to resonance.Figure 17: Glass shattering due to sound waves exciting resonance.The TV show “Mythbusters” confirmed that this is possible on the episode “Breaking Glass” which was originally broadcast on May 18, 2005.6.5 Brake SquealEver pressed on the brake in a car and heard a high frequency squeal?  This is resonance at work.  A brake rotor mode, probably around 3000 Hz or so, was excited by braking (Figure 18).Figure 18: Brake rotor has a resonance which can create audible squeal during braking.Brake rotors are symmetric structures, which can create multiple modes at the same frequency.  To reduce squeal, the rotor design should be modified to keep the modes well separated so they cannot cross excite each other.6.6 Helmholtz Resonator Air InductionThe German scientist, Hermann von Helmholtz (a friend of Ernest Werner Siemens), created theHelmholtz resonator in the 1850s. A Helmholtz resonator is a air-based tuned absorber that is designed for a specific frequency.   When blowing over the lip of an empty bottle, the resonant frequency of the trapped volume of air can be heard.The larger trapped volume of air acts like the spring (it gets compressed into the volume).  The smaller volume at the mouth, which is open to the air, acts like a mass. See the diagram inFigure 19.Figure 19: A Helmholtz resonator creates a tuned absorber (frequency fh) with a trapped volume of air (V) which acts like a spring, and an open volume of air (defined by A and L).In ducted systems, the Helmholtz resonator can be used as tuned absorber to reduce sound levels at a specific frequency.  InFigure 20, the air in the exhaust system has a 330 Hz resonant frequency. The sound pressure level at the outlet is greatly reduced by introducing a Helmholtz resonator attached to the duct. The resonator ""absorbs"" energy from the exhaust system and reduces sound at the outlet.Figure 20: Left - High sound pressure emits from a ducted muffler system, Right - A Helmholtz Resonator, properly placed and tuned to the correct frequency, reduces the sound pressure levels.These resonators can be commonly found in air induction systems, HVAC ducts, and exhaust systems.6.7 Machine Tool ChatterCutting and milling machines used to manufacture products can suffer from machine tool chatter.  When the rotational cutting speed of a machine matches the natural frequency of a cutting tool, and uneven cut occurs as shown inFigure 21.Figure 21: Left - The excitation of a cutting tool creates chatter resulting in an uneven cut.  Right - By running the machine tool away from the natural frequency of the cutting tool a even cut is produced.Identifying the machine tool resonance can be done using a modal impact test as shown inFigure 22.Figure 22: A modal impact hammer and accelerometer are used to identify the natural frequency of a cutting tool.See the article""Simcenter Testlab Impact Testing""for information on how to perform an impact measurement to identify a natural frequency.6.8 Part InspectionManufacturers strive to make parts in as consistent of a manner as possible.  By testing for the resonant frequency of parts (Figure 23) coming off the manufacturing line, defective parts can be identified.Figure 23: An automated, non-destructive, resonance test fixture for end of line inspection of manufactured parts.Both the mass and stiffness of the manufactured part must be consistent to produce the same resonant frequency.  A defect like a crack (which affects stiffness) or material preparation (could affect mass) is easily detectable if the resonant frequency shifted compared to a properly made part.  These tests can also be performed in a non-destructive manner with a 100% inspection rate.More information in the knowledge article:Non-Destructive Component Testing by Acoustic Resonance Analysis.7. Final Thoughts: ResonanceKnowing and understanding resonance is very useful! Not only can unwanted vibration be avoided, but resonance can also be used to increase the performance of a product or object.  Some examples include:The human ear can hear sound lower levels sounds between1000 and 4000 Hertz due to an acoustic resonanceof the air in the ear canal.Tuning into a radio station (at least in the analog days) is done through resonance. The electrical circuit is tuned to the radio frequency by adjusting the frequency of a capacitor.Vibrating bowls used in manufacturing applications to sort parts rely on the resonance of the bowl to create large vibration with minimal energy input.Microwave ovens use the natural frequency of water molecules to heat items quicker than a traditional oven.In the medical field, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to view inside the human body without requiring invasive procedures. A MRI is tuned to resonate with certain tissues.In a factory, parts can be inspected that they are made correctly quickly and efficiently.  By tapping the part in a non-destructive way, theacoustic resonance responseis verified against a perfectly made part.  The acoustic resonant frequencies depend on the mass and stiffness of the part.  Any flaws, for example cracks, that affect the mass and/or stiffness of the part cause the acoustic resonance to shift frequency.Hope this article was helpful for understanding natural frequencies and resonance.Questions?

Template-based documentation is associative to the operations, and updates easily when things change.DetailsIn a typical workflow includes creating a Documentation operation where you create job process sheets with information such as setup instructions, a tool list, and an operation list for the overall program. You place the Documentation operation at the beginning of the program. You then use the Work Instructions command to create and attach job process sheets to individual CAM operations. NX updates all associative data in your job process sheets.When your workflow is complete, you can publish the job process sheets as PDF or HTML files. When you select a program to publish the work instructions, NX adds all of the process sheets, in their program order, and links them to the table of contents. You can select a single operation to publish only the process sheets required by that operation.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/eliminate-errors-with-better-work-instructions,Eliminate errors with better work instructions,"OverviewNX CAM Work Instruction Authoring is integrated into the operation navigator of NX CAM software, unifying the machine instructions (CNC program) with human instructions. This allows the CNC programmer to focus on each operation as it is defined and to specify required work instructions while the information is fresh.Click on this link to view the video:https://plmsisw--c.na131.content.force.com/servlet/fileField?id=0BE4O0000008gppCreated with NX 10.0.3DetailsThe creation of computer numerical control (CNC) work instructions is generally a manual process that can take as much time as the creation of the CNC program itself. NX Work Instruction Authoring brings this process inside NX™ software so that work instructions can be developed alongside the CNC program. Like CNC programs, these instructions are associative to the design models, significantly reducing the time needed to create and update them. Configurable templates are used to define the required data and display work instruction sheets.This Tech Tip will go through a brief example and show:Creation of Work Instruction operations, which are separate items in the operation navigatorCreation of work instructions as part of other operations in the setupUnique view capture is remembered for each instruction step in order to best illustrate each stepDrawings can be includedTool lists and operation lists are easily created for any program groupTool paths are visualized for each operation instructionComplete work instructions are published with just a clickWork instructions are associative and updated easilyAbout the PresentersSteve Scigliano is a Product manager in the Manufacturing Engineering Solutions group at Siemens PLM.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/multi-axis-finishing-with-nx-cam,Multi Axis Finishing with NX CAM,"For finishing in 5 axis, NX CAM software development is focused on the “Guiding Curves” operation. Our NX CAM customers report guiding curves to be very flexible with the geometries and patterns it handles, yet providing good machine behavior and finish quality. In the future Tech Tips I’ll write more about it, but to give a better perspective about Guiding Curves, let’s start with some explanations about Variable Contour operation using Surface Area and Streamline. Knowing how the system works, helps you guide it to do what you want it to do.There are many aspects we can cover, but I will concentrate on three important ones:Coverage and PatternPosition, Projection and Collision AvoidanceTool axis policyThe Coverage and Pattern is covered in this NX CAM Tech Tip. The other two as well as detailed description of the Guiding Curves operation will be detailed in separate Tech Tips.Note: this article is describing the behavior of NX CAM software, but many pieces are common to surface base (NURBS) path generation in other software.Coverage and PatternSurface AreaGenerating the pattern on an arbitrary set of faces with variable slopes is pretty challenging. Some of the faces you see on the screen have a parametric representation called U and V. To visualize it you can use the modeling ‘Isoparametric Curve’ tool to draw those:In Surface area when you select this face as the drive, the system will use this parametric representation to draw the pattern. ‘Zig’ / ‘Zigzag’ / ‘Zigzag with lifts’ will go along U or V. ‘Follow Periphery’ will offset from the outer shape in the parametric field.Helical will only work if the drive performs a close loop (i.e. - a cylinder).In case that you want to machine more than one face at a time, three things may happen:The next face I select has a matching parametrization so the system can merge those to a grid of well behaving U/V: it also can be extended to the next row(s):The next face has a parametrization that do not match. This will pop up the “Grid Error”:In this case the curves on the right lower side of the selected face cannot find continuousmatching curves to the faces already selected.In a limited set of cases you can “force” the system to accept an irregular gridlike by increasing the chaining Tolerance:It is a bit experimental and the results might not be smooth but it is useful to know it and try when needed.StreamlineTo handle the cases where a well behaving grid cannot be extracted from the cut area geometry we have Streamline. In Modeling there is a tool to create “Through Curves” surface:Which uses two flow curves to blend a surface in between. As you can see the surface is sometime inside and outside the part. As further the drive deviates from the part – your tool path will stick less to the intent. To get a bit closer you can use Through Curves Mesh.With proper selection the surface is way closer to the path, yet it is not perfect since we miss some cross curves. In manufacturing the same is available in streamline.Only Flow:Flow and Cross:In case you need cross curves but the geometry does not have those and you do not want to stretch your modeling skills, NX CAM enables you to generate those on the part:This will be detailed in another article.The parametric representation allows you to trim or extend. Because it is parametric – you cannot use a distance value (i.e. extend by 2 mm or 50% Tool), instead you can only use a % value:The pattern from the drive is later projected to the cut area / part so the real coverage cannot extend beyond the (extended) drive, nor beyond the cut area / part geometry. This topic and other Position, Projection and Collision Avoidance topics and a detailed description of Guiding curves and how it is different will be discussed in my next NX CAM software Tech Tip.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/optimize-machining-using-barrel-mills-in-nx-cam-software,Optimize machining using barrel mills in NX CAM software,"Barrel cutting tools are being used more and more by manufacturers because of the unique advantages they offer. These tools, with effective radius between 50 and 1000+ mm, help you achieve the desired scallop height with less cutting passes. This can shorten machining time, while improving surface finish.Barrel cutting tools are used for various machining operations, including finishing of flat and slightly curved walls, as well as deburring.NX CAM softwaresupports programming using barrel mills enabling you to improve your machining efficiency.This tech tip explains the best practices about using barrel mills and it also highlights some of the new functionality in NX CAM 12.0.2.Below, we will describe how to define barrel cutting tools and how to use these tools for NC programming.Barrel tool definitionIn NX CAM 12.0.2, we added a new tool type, Tangent Barrel, which simplifies the user interface. As shown in the example below, the new settings enable you to easily define and use barrel mills for NC programming.Note that in the older versions of NX, you can define these tools as ‘BARREL’ or ‘MILL_10_PARAMETER’ but it requires some settings that are not always obvious from the vendor catalogs.Taper barrel mill tool needs to be defined using a ‘MILL_10_PARAMETER’Note: MILL_10_PARAMETER does not allow to define the upper fillet, so the tool shape follows the untrimmed corner. This fillet is not a recommended working area of the tool and this representation assures we are always on the safe side. Note that this is not a functional limitation.To help you find the key settings, we’ve created the attached NX part (.prt) file:Taper barrel to 10 params Tool Conversion 12.0.2User fills in the data from the vendor catalog into the expressions (blue), and it will generate a solid body of the tool with 3 PMIs to be used in the CAM tool definition. Follow the green arrows to set those correctly when building the 10 parameters tool.In future releases, we are planning to add a new tool type in NX to simplify the definition of these tools.Using data provided by Fraisa, we created some of their tools in NX:These predefined tools let you browse and select a tool:Fraisa Taper Barrel tools.prtAttached prt contains several tools defined in NX.NC programming using barrel cutting toolsNX CAM softwaresupports barrel mills in Surface Contouring (Fixed and Variable Axis) for long time. In Variable Axis, it is recommended to use the “Swarf Drive” option:Set the tilt angle as recommended by the vendor (α/2):Courtesy Franken Expert Tool CatalogWith appropriate increase / decrease of the tilt angle, you can control the contact point on the tool (Ring Height):Tilt angle = 18 Deg – Contact closer to tipTilt angle =15 Deg – Nominal AngleTilt angle =10 Deg – contact closer to shaftStarting with NX CAM 12.0.2, the Multi-Blade Blade Finish operation was optimized to support these tools for blisk machining.The Guiding Curves capability in the next release will be expanded to support barrel mills. The user will be able to directly control the Ring Height, Swarf angle and use Tilt tool axis for avoidance and smoothing. We will make it available through the Early Adaptors Program (EAP). In future, we will develop a set of operations targeted to machine pockets using barrel mill tools.Please contact me directly ateddy.finaro@siemens.comif you need more information.Before you go, check out this new two minute video made by our friends at Fehlmann AG and FRAISA.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/nx-cam-innovation-adaptive-milling-pillar-cutting,Adaptive Milling Pillar Cutting,"When you are using Adaptive Milling to do a morphed spiral to rough an open region (Face Milling or geometries without walls), it can happen that a small pillar is left in the middle during the cut. Especially in hardened or very tough materials it might occur that this pillar starts to bend instead of being cut and, therefore, is a high possibility that it is getting work hardened. This can damage the tool or can heavily increase tool wear. It can also happen that the remaining pillar is getting ripped off and might remain behind in pockets or cavities of the part.Following tools for finish toolpaths might take damage through plunging on that piece.This is why Siemens came up with the innovative Adaptive Milling Pillar Cutting feature to address this common problem, which occurs in high dynamic cutting toolpaths. You have the ability to select theCut with Helical Motionin the Cutting Parameters dialog in Adaptive Milling.CapabilitiesAutomatically detects, if a small pillar is left during the Spiral Facing in Adaptive MillingLeaves a cylindrical geometry which is milled with Helical MotionCustom Feeds and Speeds and the Ramp Angle from the Helical Engage settings in the NCM dialog will be applied to the Pillar CuttingThe full capabilities of the Pillar Cutting are included in NX version 12.0.2We recommend using the Pillar Cutting for hard and tough materials and a cut depth up to three times the diameter. In softer steels and aluminum, continuing with the Adaptive Pattern is still the preferred choice, since this has advantages in the machining time.The video shows the capabilities of the Adaptive Milling Pillar Cutting.If you are using theCut with Helical Motionoption, Adaptive Milling will automatically detect when a pillar is being left. It will leave a cylinder and cut this cylinder with a helical motion. The helical motion uses the Ramp Angle and Custom Feed & Speed parameters, which are being set in the Closed Area Engages in the NCM dialogue.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/containment-loops-selection-within-the-variable-axis-guiding-curves-operation-in-nx-12,Containment Loops Selection within the Variable Axis Guiding Curves Operation in NX 12,"We think you will find this helpful information about the Containment Loops selection found within the new Variable Axis Guiding Curves operation in NX 12 for manufacturing.Containment loops in essence is simple to use yet pretty powerful. Here are some tips about it:The entire Guiding Curves operation expects contact space data, meaning the containment loops, same as the guiding curves must be projected to the cut area.The pattern is created across the entire cut area (regardless of the containment loops) and later trimmed to the containment loops.You can see how the step-overs are following the containment even if it has corners.The system support one or more loops. It knows how to nest them:Containment loops must not lie partially / entirely outside the cut area!The trimming will happen as the contact point on the tool is touching it which allows to use the same curve to do complementary operation with different tool diameters and orientations (3+2X / 5X):In fact, if you do not manually select Containment Loops, the system will automatically identify them on the edges of the cut area. In rare cases interior gaps between sheet bodies may be detected as Containment Loops which cause unexpected interruptions in the toolpath. In this case manual selection of the exterior loop may resolve this problem.Tip: When you select Guiding Curves or Containment Loops, a pick with single curve selection will overshoot the section you really need.If you activate the ‘Stop at Intersections,’ the same pick will end with a contained curve ---- such that you can get the containment you want with less geometry creation.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/choosing-the-best-non-cutting-move-smoothing-options-for-your-machine,Choosing the Best Non-Cutting Move Smoothing Options for Your Machine,"The option to smooth the corners of non-cutting move (NCM) motions was extended to planar operations such as Floor & Wall, Planar Mill, Cavity Mill, and etc. in NX12 for manufacturing. This can be seen in the NCM dialog of these planar operations and others under the Smoothing tab as the Smooth Corners check box.Smoothing the NCM motions of a tool path is useful for reducing wear on a machine tool. The hard corners of the transfers, engages, and retracts are turned into arc or spline motions based on the NCM types that were chosen. Some people will argue that these additional arc and spline motions will cause wear on the machine tool motors driving the axes. However, our conversations with a machine tool manufacturer revealed that while this may be true, there is a reduction in wear on the machine tool's ball screws. Since the cost of replacing a ball screw is typically much greater in both parts and labor time than replacing a worn out axis motor, it becomes economical to use the Smooth Corners functionality. This is especially true for businesses doing high production runs, or with machine tools that work around the clock.However, not all machine tools are created equal. Smoothing the transfer motions, which usually get output as a rapid move (G00), can have less than favorable consequences in the real motion of the machine for certain controllers. Trying to move through these transfer arcs while rapid positioning can actually cause the machine to slow down and have choppy motions.Here is an example. The tool path shown in the picture below is a simple Floor & Wall operation with the engage and retract motions set to Linear and the smoothing set to the parameters shown in the NCM dialog picture above.In this case, all the hard corners of every NCM have been fitted with a 15mm smoothing radius as specified. The tool path looks nice, but the particular machine this was made for didn't handle the smooth G00 motions very well. Here is a video of that tool path in action. No material is being cut because this study is only focusing on the NCM motions.This video content is no longer available.(view in My Videos)The interesting thing is that the engage and retract motions, which are output as linear motions (G01) at the same feed rate as the cutting motions, are handled very well by the machine and actually seem faster than the rapid arc motions. Some NX CAM software users would then advocate changing the rapid outputs to a feed mode, which can certainly be done the Feeds and Speeds dialog of an operation, but there is a newer way that may be more favorable to some.The project to extend the NCM smoothing capabilities to other operation types came with an added parameter named Smooth Transfer Move Corners. This can be seen in the picture of the NCM dialog previously shown. This check box gives the ability for the user to decide whether or not to smooth the transfer motions while smoothing the engage and retract motions. The tool path in the picture below shows the output when Smooth Corners is turned on and Smooth Transfer Move Corners is turned off.The linear engage and retract motions are smoothed to the specified radius while the transfer motions retain the hard corners. Here is that tool path in action.This video content is no longer available.(view in My Videos)The motions are much better now. This partial option reduces wear on the machine tool in some NCM motions while retaining the maximum feed rate of G00 when transferring from one cut to the next.As an added bonus, there will likely be a reduction in cycle time when using NCM smoothing. Take the example of the part file shown in the pictures. Three separate tool paths had their total times recorded after running on the machine tool. The first Floor & Wall path had no NCM smoothing at all and took 23 seconds. The second path was the one that had all of the NCM motions smoothed and took 27 seconds. This is due to the slow down in the rapid arc motions. The third path was the partially smoothed Floor & Wall tool path with transfers unsmoothed. This path took 21 seconds. These differences are small but so are the tool paths. Imagine scaling these differences to a much bigger tool path. Also, there has been feedback from customers using this on bigger paths with a huge reduction in cycle time in a production machining environment.So, with options to smooth NCM motions for multiple machine tool capabilities, and potential savings in machine maintenance and cycle time, who can afford not to be smooth?"

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/post-configurator-training-presentation,Post Configurator training presentation,"The new Post Configurator is being delivered starting with NX10.0.1. Similar in concept to Post Builder, it is integrated in NX rather than being a separate executable. Its architecture also allows for some layering of knowledge in base, controller, and customer layers. This will make your posts more re-useable and shorten the time needed to create an additional post.This tech tip article shares some in-person training materials on this new post creation tool, to help get you familiar with its similarities and differences from Post Builder. All of the files referenced are included in a ZIP (.7z) file attached to this article. Thanks to Florian Weisse for sharing these materials!Introduction:In late November of 2016 SPLM gave a 3 days training to enable advanced NX CAM users in using the new post processor creation tool “Post Configurator”. Goal of this training is to teach the basics and philosophy and to give an outlook about what is to come for Post Configurator. It aimed to train new as well as experienced post developers in how to create a new post processor, to have a look into what options the integrated libraries offer through the user interfaceWe understand that this article cannot replace a full in-person training session, but still we hope these materials and files offer some helpful insights into the new Post Configurator and to give some background information on how to get started with it.The included ZIP file has files in the following folders:SlidesThere are 9 presentation files in the ZIP file, in PDF format. These were shown throughout the 3 day training and cover everything that was explained in the sessions. They should:give insights into the reasoning behind Post Configuratorshow how to create the first post processorshow how to change simple settingsshow how to do in-depth experts Tcl-based modifications to your post processorStep-by-step these presentations cover the full spectrum from easy UI changes to the usage of custom UDEs. At the end of the sequence we are giving an outlook on the new support for multi-chain and multi-function machines and the new support for the Okuma controller.Snippets:The included .TCL files are the code snippets used and developed throughout the training. Providing them for you here should minimize typing errors and help more easily show complex code examples.KitstoreLibs_4.1.2:This folder contains the latest library update and can be used in NX11.0 to have an early look into the new controller and to benefit of bug fixes and improvements of the underlying post libraries before NX11.0.1 releases. Please copy the files in the archive into the UGII directory of your NX 11.0 installation and replace existing files.As with any pre-release code, you MUST backup your orginals: “MACH\post_configurator” and “MACH\resource\post_configurator” before doing so.Documentation:These PDF files are hard copies of the pre-release NX11.0.1 documentation for Post Configurator, including the latest changes. Unfortunately, the PDF conversion from xml was not perfect and some parts of the output is cut off. The online help for NX11.0.1 will not have this problem. At least it gives an idea of the documentation to come. Both the available options of the different controllers as well as a documentation of all available commands of Post Configurator can be found in here.Disclaimer:Without the in-person instructor, the benefit of this material is limited and everything is provided as it is. Some portions of the training refer to un-released and preview software, with the intent to give post developers a view of the expected future capabilities.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/nx-9-shop-docs-common-questions-and-answers,NX 9 Shop Docs Common Questions and Answers,"OverviewDocumenting the manufacturing plan and the specifics of the NC program are important pieces of the part manufacturing process. This Tech Tip covers several Questions and Answers regarding Shop Documentation in NX CAM.Created with NX 9DetailsNine questions about Shop Documentation customization are compiled here:How do I find the MOM variable that corresponds to a particular user input?How do I find a MOM variable that is not listed on sheet 2 of the OOTB template?How can I combine mom variables to get a sum total?What does the message ""Error opening output file"" mean?Does Shop Docs support any version of Excel prior to Excel 2007?Can the Postprocess dialog box still be used to create shop documentation?How do I output a Microsoft Word document?How do I output a pdf file?How can I specify the number of decimal places in Shop Docs output?Following these questions, the Additional Notes section covers important need-to-know facts about Shop Docs.Question:How do I find the MOM variable that corresponds to a particular user input? For example, I would like to output theStepover Maximum Distancein my shop documentation. How do I find the MOM variable that corresponds toMaximum Distance?Answer:In NX, edit an operation (i.e. Cavity Mill) that contains the user input in the dialog box.Key in a unique, identifiable value such as1.2345:3. ClickOKto finish editing the operation.4. With the operation highlighted in the Operation Navigator, selectShop Documentation.5. In the Shop Documentation dialog box, select the desired Report Format (template), set theReview TooltoOn.6. ClickOKto generate Shop Doc output.7. Close the NX Post Debug lister dialog.8. Go to the directory where the part file is saved.9. In that directory, open the newest *_debug.outfile in a text editor (sort by Date Modified).10. Do a search for the text string1.234and you will find:11. The MOM variable you will need to use in your customized template ismom_stepover_distance.Question:How do I find a MOM variable for operation machining time that is not listed on sheet 2 of the OOTB template?Answer:Sheet 2 is anincompletelist of MOM variables. While sheet 2 lists the most commonly used MOM variables, all MOM variables that Shop Docs uses can be referenced by using theReview Toolor found by searching thedebug.outfile.1. Select an operation (referred to as a “member” in the Review Tool) in the Operation Navigator and selectShop Documentation.2. In the Shop Documentation dialog box, select the desired Report Format (template), set theReview TooltoOn:3. ClickOKto generate Shop Doc output.In the NX Post Debug lister dialog, click on an event in the first column to list the associated MOM variables in the second column. You might be able to find the desired MOM variable using this “hunt & peck” method, but searching thedebug.outfile for the desired MOM variable is easier. Do this:4. Go to the directory where the part file is saved.5. In that directory, open the newest*_debug.outfile in a text editor (sort by Date Modified).6. Do a search for the wordtimeand you will find:Var: mom_toolpath_time = 94.71146749849486900This value equates to the Time listed in the Operation Navigator for the selected member or members. It is the NX operation machining time as opposed to the postprocessor machining time.7. If you scroll up you will see that this variable is listed under Event 5: MOM_MEMBERS_HDRThis is the event inside the NX Post Debug Lister in which you will find the variables of the member (operation) you selected.8. Copymom_toolpath_timeinto your customized Shop Docs template.Question:How can I combine mom variables to get a sum total?Answer:To add, for example, tool length and shank length and output in the tool list select template:The syntax is:'= ${mom_tool_length} + ${mom_tool_tapered_shank_length}The calculation is done only when the html output is displayed in Excel.Question:What does the message ""Error opening output file"" mean?Answer:It means you had an output window displayed when attempting to create another output. Close the displayed output window(s) before generating another output.Question:Does Shop Docs support any version of Excel prior to Excel 2007?Answer:As we provided our templates in .xlsx, Shop Docs only supports Excel 2007 and later.Question:Can the Postprocess dialog box still be used to create shop documentation?Answer:No.Question:How do I output a Microsoft Word document?Answer:For .txt output, change the file extension to .doc. Just create a .txt file and in a explorer window change the extension to .doc – then double click.For html output viewed in Excel, save as .xlsx file. Open in Word and save as .docx.Question:How do I output a pdf file?Answer:Shop Docs does not output in pdf format directly.  Output in Excel, and then save as pdf.Question:How can I specify the number of decimal places in Shop Docs output?Answer:In NX9, you can control the number of decimal places output in both html and Excel.  In your Excel template, format the cell so that Category = Number, and decimal places = the number of decimal places you wish to output. Prior to NX9, specifying the number of decimal places will only affect Excel output.Additional NotesUGII_CAM_SHOP_DOC_DIRenvironment variable determines where the Shop Doc function looks for templates2. Theshopdoc_excel.tclfile inside the excel_templates folder specifies where Shop Docs will look for the excel.exe file. Example:set execute_file {C:\\apps\\MSOffice\\Office14\\excel.exe}Be sure this path is correct for your installation if you have Excel. If it does not find Excel (or if you don’t have it), then the output will be displayed by the HTML browser only.3. Display Output toggle:Display OutputOn= displays HTML output in Excelandbrowser for HTML/Excel templates.Display OutputOn= displays text output for TEXT templates.Display OutputOff= displays HTML output in Excel for HTML/Excel templates.Display OutputOff= displays no output for TEXT templates.4. Other platforms (MacOS, Linux) will not display the output automatically.5. “Select” templates work only if asingleobject is selected.Warningsare displayed in listing device and syslog if:A template containing MOM_cycle_objects for selected objects is used, but no object is selected.A template containing MOM_cycle_objects for selected objects is used and more than one object is selected.6.

Shopdocs is supported in Teamcenter. However:When running in managed mode, Shop Documentation output must be checked intoTeamcenter9.0or later. Shop documentation files will not import correctly into a pre-9.0 version of Teamcenter.You can open HTML output generated from new templates in TC9.1 by double-clicking the HTML output icon inside the Manufacturing Activities tab. In TC9.0, you must open the HTML output using the TC Navigator.All old (pre-NX8) templates work with TC just as they did in NX7.5.8. Obsolete TemplatesThe Postprocess dialog will no longer be used to create Shop Documentation. The following templates will be commented out of the Postprocessor list:Note:If you want to use pre-NX 8 templates, remove the comment sign (#) in the shop_doc.dat file . The file is located in MACH\resource\shop_doc.9. In NX9, you can create notes for operations and descriptions (up to 130 characters) for all objects (Geometry groups, Programs, and Methods) in the Operation Navigator.  A Notes and Description object may be customized into the operation dialog box. The Notes button will display a dialog box which can be used for comments, notes, revision history, instructions, etc.Use${mom_operation_description}in the table of the shopdoc_template_English_operation_list_select.xlsx template to output descriptions in Shop Docs.Use${mom_operation_notes}in the table of the shopdoc_template_English_operation_list_select.xlsx template to output descriptions in Shop Docs.Important:${mom_operation_notes}does not work in NX9. PR6951564 has been submitted.10. “Received an error 1770010” will display in NX9 if a value cannot be output  because the parameter specified by a mom variable does not exist in the operation (ex. mom_wall_stock cannot output a value for a drilling operation). The correct behavior is to output  “- -“ when a value cannot be output. This problem has been corrected in  NX9.0.1.11.Mom variables cannot be read from objects in the Operation Navigator other than operations. This, for example, is why ${mom_part_material_code} can only be used within the template table, displaying output for each operation and cannot be used within the title area. This is a known issue that is currently being addressed by an open problem report. If you wish to display the part material in the title section of your Shop Doc output, you need to use a part attribute:12. Printing and Page FormattingThe Excel template provides minimal configurable options to help you specify the content length of each page.The numeric input field next to PAGE CONTENT LENGTH determines the distance between the Page : ${cur_page} of ${total_pages} markers in the .html output. The value must be a positive real number.If the value is “0” or empty, the content will be output without pagination. That is, “Page: 1 of 1” will appear at the top of the output and no other markers will follow it.If the value you enter is greater than 0 but less than the title block length (distance between TITLE START and the first TABLE START markers)and REPEAT TITLE is set to Yes, then minimum length between markers is the title block + 1 table row. This assures that the title block plus 1 successive table row will appear on each page.If the value is greater than 0 but less than the title block length (distance between ###TITLE START### and the first ###TABLE START### markers),and REPEAT TITLE is set to No, then the minimum length between markers is the title block. This assures that the title block will appear on the first page followed by a continuous table on subsequent pages.Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/turbomachinery-milling-with-nx-cam-part-3-blade-finishing,"Turbomachinery Milling with NX CAM Part 3, Blade Finishing","OverviewThis is article 3 of a 3 part series that describes the steps and considerations for milling a multi-bladed part using NX CAM Turbomachinery Milling.Part 1 - SetupPart 2 - RoughingPart 3 - FinishingCreated with NX 7.5DetailsBlade finishingBlade finish shares some aspects with the Multi blade roughing (see part 2 of this series): Stocks, Cut levels, Tool axis orientation (beside “Rotate about” control). The different aspects are detailed below.Step 1 - Specify the Drive Method settings:Geometry to Finish– Here the user selects between (main) blade, splitter 1, splitter 2, etc. (splitters available according to the geometries defined.Sides to Cut– here the user selects which sides of the blade are to be finished. The sides are determined using theSnip Points, so regardless if the blade is made of one surface going all around or many surfaces, the user can still control the sides to cut.In case the trailing edge was not selected as part of the blade geometry do not use the option “All Sides” to avoid gouging it.Leading and trailing edges are controlled similar to the Roughing operation. Availability of the controls depends on the “Sides to Cut” selected.TheBlade Finishoperation does not use the graphical selection of the start point. Instead the user controls the“Cut Pattern”,“Cut Direction” and “Start Point” from the dialog. Availability of controls here also depends on the “Sides to Cut” selected, as well as previousDrive Methodsettings selected.Blade Finishdoes not provide extensions. UseNon-CuttingMoves instead.Helical tool path is not available yet. It is planned to be added in a short while. (Update: added in NX8.5)Step 2 - Specify other cutting parameters:Many of the controls such as “Path Soothing %” and “Blank Consideration” are irrelevant.Relevant parameters have identical usage as in the roughing operation.Step 3 - Other considerations:Blade Finishcovers the blade and blend geometries down to the hub.Sometimes it is required to use a large diameter tool to finish the upper portion of the blade and a smaller diameter tool to finish the blends. It can be done in two operations where each uses a different tool and depth of cut. Both would use “Interpolated from Shroud to Hub” as the “Depth Mode” but “Start %” and “End %” are different. i.e. first works 0-85% and second 80-100%. In this case the region 80-85% is covered by both operations to provide overlapping. Static and dynamic previews help to set required percentages for the first operation.Blend finishingBlend Finishingshares some aspects with the blade finish: Stocks, Tool axis orientation. The different aspects are detailed below.Step 1 - Specify Drive Method settings:Geometry to Finish– Here the user selects between (main) blade Blend, splitter 1 Blend, splitter 2 Blend, etc. (splitter Blends are available according to the geometries defined).Sides to cut– here the user selects which sides of the blend are to be finished. The sides are determined using theSnip Points, so regardless if the blade is made of one surface going all around or many surfaces, the user can still control theSides to Cut.In case the trailing edge was not selected as part of the blade geometry do not use the option “All Sides” to avoid gouging it.Leading and trailing edges are controlled similar as for the Blade finish operation.Availability of the controls depends on the “Sides to Cut” selected.The range of the step over’s is defined by two parameters:Step 2 - Specify Drive method:Lower Blend Edge– use theLower Blend Edgeor theDual Contact Passas reference.Reference Tool– user sets the diameter of the ball tool used to finish the blade and hub. Moreover, he can add overlap on hub and overlap on blade.Step 3 - Specify Cut Band:Offsets- Based on the distances on hub and on blade theMax Stepoveris used to calculate the amount of passes that will equally distributed along the cut.Stepovers– the user specifies number of stepovers on the hub and number of stepovers on the blade. Note that 0 on hub and 0 on blade means only 1 ‘pencil pass’ is generated.TheBlend Finishoperation does not use the graphical selection of the start point. Instead the user controls the “Cut Pattern”, “Cut Direction” and “Start Point” from the dialog. Availability of controls here also depends on the “Sides to Cut” selected, as well as previous Drive settings selected.Sequencing provides all options as found also in 3 axis flow cut operations: ‘Inside-Out’; ‘Outside-In’; ‘Steep Last’;Steep First’; ‘Inside-Out Alternate’; ‘Outside-In Alternate’.Blade Finishdoes not provide extensions. UseNon-Cutting Movesinstead.Helical tool path is not available yet. It is planned to be added in a short while.  (Update: added in NX8.5)Step 4 - Specify Other cutting parameters:Many of the controls such as “Path Soothing %” and “Blank Consideration” are irrelevant.Relevant parameters have identical usage as in the roughing operation.Special Topic – Interpolated Tool Axis OrientationThe default method of ‘Automatic’tool axis provides quick and good gouge free smooth orientations along the tool path. However, to get smoother results as well as to avoid cases where the ‘Automatic’method fails to locate gouge free orientation (hence tool path is trimmed and reconnected by NCMs) in NX7.5.2 we offer a new method “Interpolated Vector”.Since this option is in preview state in 7.5.2 you will need to set a new ENV: UGII_CAM_5AXIS_BLADE_FINISH_INTERP with the value 1. (Update: this feature is no longer preview as of NX8.) Limitations in 7.5.2 are detailed at the end of this sectionThe concept here is that the user can set the tool alignment along the lowest cut level and those alignments are reused for the upper cut levels in a parametric manner.After defining the geometry, stocks and tool, change theTool Axisorientation to ‘Interpolated Vector’:The system will spend some time to generate the lower rail along which you can define the orientations and the system points defined by a yellow arrow:In case the geometry is not contiguous or tool not defined you may get some warnings / error messages same as during tool path generation.You will also get theInterpolated Vectordialog:There are a few activities you can do at this stage:Display preview of tools along lower railClick the displayPreviewbutton:You will get tools displayed at interpolated locations and orientations according to settings in the list:Those tools are colored green for safe positions or red for gouging positions. Those settings are controlled by User preferences.To clear those images – refresh the screen (use refresh command orF5)Change orientation of that tool at system pointsSelect one of the arrows on the screen or from the list in the dialog. You will get the tool displayed at that point and a dynamicCSYS. Grab one of the rotary handles and rotate the tool to the required position:You can also enter the angle or change the dynamic snap angle from the GUIF (key-in box that accompanies interactive handles)In order to copy the initial orientation from another point right click on the other point and select “UseThis Orientation”At any time you can reset to default the orientation of a point.System points cannot be deleted or moved.Add, reorient, Move, delete User pointsTo add a point press the “Add New Set” on the dialog and select any point along the rail.The point was added to the list and you can change its orientation using all options described for system points.User points can be moved to any other point along the rail. Any attempt to place it off the rail will snap it to the closest point on the rail.To remove a user point select it and either press the X button near the list or right click on the arrow and select “Remove”.While rotating a vector, system can dynamically show the impact of the action on closest locations (including gouge check).To do so check thePreviewcheckbox in the dialog:Result:To remove this dynamic preview – uncheck the checkbox.Display Interpolated vectors along the lower rail:To clear those vectors – refresh the screen (use refresh command orF5).Tilt Clearance Angleis not active in NX7.5.2.In NX8 it will provide same safety clearance from the part as inAutomatictool axis.Reset to Defaultfrom the dialog will delete all user points and will reset all system points to the default orientation.When copying an operation to another file or copying it to be used for a different blade / splitter in the current file it is recommended to use it to avoid applying irrelevant settings.The list in the dialog contains all points. For each point it shows:Whether it is system or user pointIts U parameter (parametric location along the rail)Number of rail (in 7.5.2 only one rail is available)Tool orientation at that point in terms of i, j, k.Suggested user workflow:1. Check thePreviewcheckbox.2. After invoking theInterpolated Vectordialog press the displayPreview.3. Based on red tools decide where you want to locally manipulate the orientations. Select an existing point or add a new one.4. PressF5to clear the screen from the static preview.5. Rotate the tool at that point till you get it and its nearest instances collision free.6. Press the displayPreviewagain and see where the next location that needs manipulation is and continue this way till you get the expected alignments all over.  Note that sometimes you may manipulate orientations to minimize tool axis changes. For that you canCopy Orientationfrom previous / next point.7. PressOKin the dialog andGeneratethe operation. On the lowest cut your tool path is most likely OK, however upper cut levels may be gouging so the tool path is trimmed and reconnected by NCMs:8. Go back to theInterpolated Vectordialog and change existing point/ add new ones to increases the margins there:Limitations in 7.5.2 are:This method is applicable only for blade finish and not for the rest of operation types.This method is applicable only for cut levels Interpolate from shroud to hub.In any case where the generated tool path is potentially gouging, that segment is trimmed and replaced by NCMs. (Update: starting with NX8 the software automatically attempts to tilt it to avoid the collision)Update: starting with NX8 we support user orientations defined for the upper rail as well.Sometimes as you try to rotate the tool it jumps to a different orientation or rotate against the dynamic handle direction. To avoid that you can press the reset to default when right clicking on the arrow.As a preview option in NX 7.5.2, users should be careful about implementing this in production work.Do you have a question?Click 'Add a Comment' below to ask it.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/how-to-simulate-any-g-code-file-in-nx-cam,How to simulate any G-code file in NX CAM,"OverviewA milling program was created outside of the NX CAM application. After editing the G-code file in a text editor, the edits need verification. Below are the steps to simulate the G-code program inside NX CAM using integrated machine tool simuation.Created with NX 8Details1. Create the Part and the Blank geometry. (The Part Geometry is only required if gouge checking is performed.)2. Create a manufacturing setup and move the MCS to the correct location in reference to the part shape. In the MCS specify a Fixture Offset number of “1” to be used for G54 output. All simulation setups require that an MCS with a Fixture Offset of “1” be present even if unused. If a G55 through G59 are used in the G-code file than an additional MCS will need to be created for each of these. The Fixture Offset value that is entered in the MCS will be 2 through 6, respectively.3. Load the simulation machine into the part file.4. When loading the machine specify the “Part Mount Junction” so that the part can be positioned on the simulation machine correctly. Use the “Workpiece Parts” pane to select the part model to be used for Gouge Checking.5. Create all the tools in NX that will be used in the program. Add these tools to the Pocket with the correct Tool Number and then alter the Adjust and Cutcom Registers to match those used in the G-code file. If a Tool, Adjust or Cutcom value is used in the G-code file which cannot be found associated to an NX Tool than an error will be displayed during simulation.6. Open the “Machine Tool Navigator” and locate the “Workpiece” in the Setup section. Select the model that will be used as blank geometry in the simulation. If any machining fixtures are used, a vise for example, they can be added under “Fixtures”.7. To start the simulation go to ‘Tools -> Simulate Machine Code File’ and, when prompted, select the G-code file that will be simulated.On the “Simulation Control Panel” check “On” the “Show 3D Material Removal” option and press “Play” to simulate. Make sure that a G20 or a G21 is included in the G-code file so that the machine simulates in the correct part units.Do you have a question?Click 'Add a Comment' below to ask it.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/turbomachinery-milling-with-nx-cam-part-1-setup,"Turbomachinery Milling with NX CAM Part 1, Setup","OverviewThis is article 1 of a 3 part series that describes the process steps and considerations for milling a multi-bladed part using NX CAM Turbomachinery Milling.Part 1 - SetupPart 2 - RoughingPart 3 - FinishingCreated with NX 7.5DetailsStep 1 – Load the templateLoad from the template file the MCS. It will bring along the Part andMULTI_BLADE_GEOM:If needed, when defining the MCS you can set a cylindrical clearance.Step 2 – Process designDecide if:More than one roughing operation is needed. If so, you must define and use a blank in order to do efficient re-roughing in a second step. If not, you don’t need to define blank - it impacts the performance of generating the roughing operation. The fact that only ball tools are supported in this version may influence this decision. (note: NX 9 can rough turbo components with flat and bull-nosed tools.)Blades should be finished all around or leave edge(s) to be milled by a separate edge finish operation.The fact that the current version does not contain a dedicated edge finish operation may influence this decision.Step 3 – WorkpieceIn the workpiece define the following:Part– the geometry in the “zone of interest”. Hub, blade, blend and splitters must be subset ofPart. Selecting too many faces (i.e. – on the other side of the impeller) will impact the performance.Check- any geometry that may interfere with the expected toolpath. Selecting geometry clearly outside the milling zone will impact performance. Blade, blend, hub and splitters in the milling area are considered. No need to define them asCheck.Checkgeometry is not instanced. In case there areCheckgeometry faces / bodies attached to each blade / splitter, you must select them all.If the trailing edge of the blade is part of one rotary face all around, this face is not part of the blade geometry, so it is recommended that you select it as a check. In some rare cases the top of the blade also needs to be selected asCheck(when the shroud is not part of the blade geometry).In some rare cases the tool needs to tilt so much that interferes with a blade beyond the milling zone (not the one bounding the milling zone). In this case it needs to be explicitly selected asCheck.Other cases where usingCheckis required.In the case whenCheckgeometry is needed locally for one operation but interferes with other operations, it should be selected from within the operation dialog.Blank– required only if an In-Process Workpiece (IPW) consideration is needed (see step 2 above). If required, select the geometry used for turning.Step 4 – Blade geometry selectionSet the axis of rotation to follow the impeller rotary axis. Note that from now on the edge along the positive direction would be referred as leading edge regardless its functional role.Hub– Can be single surface or patched, can be all around the Impeller or cover only a segment of it. Needs to extend at least between leading and trailing edge (Can go beyond). This face(s) must be rotary around axis of rotation.Shroud– this represents the rotational face(s) covering the top of the blade. Here you can select either top face(s) of the main blade or the appropriate faces from the geometry used for turning.orBlade– selectBladefaces without blend and top. These faces can span to theHub,can go below it or leave a gap from it (as long as the gap between theHuband theBlade/ blend is larger than tool radius).Note: the area to be rough milled is to the right side of the selectedBlade(CCW around rotary axis).Usually, the trailing edge is not included in theBladedefinition. But in case the trailing edge needs to be selected as part of theBlade,but is actually part of a rotary face around theBladeas shown here......then you need to extract that face (if it is a solid body) and trim it so that the applicable portion of it could be selected:Blade Blend– specifyBlendgeometry. This is not a required input in the case when the geometry does not contain it, yet it is required that the radius of the used tool is larger than the expectedBlendradius.Splitters– through theDefine Splittersdialog you can define up to 5 differentSplitters.EachSplitteris a combination of wall faces and blend faces. The selectedSplittershould be next to the selected mainBladeon its right (CCW about the axis). In the case where there are multipleSplittersbetween two mainBlades,select them in sequence from left to right. EachSplittershould be selected separately, even if twoSplittersshare identical geometry to their surrounding (otherwise this can slow down tool path generation).Number of Blades– Number of mainBladeson the impeller.Step 5 – Operation creationCreate each operation using an appropriate template.Make sure that the operationGeometryis set properly as the definedBLADE_GEOM.Step 6 – Tool selectionOnly ball end mill tools are supported. (note: starting in NX9, roughing can be done with flat or bull-nosed tools.) Define or select the required tool including its shank and holder.With theEdit / Displaydialog open, enable the “Point on Face”  () snapping and place the tool on theHubat the narrowest point between theBladesand / orSplitters.Use the dynamic handles to place the tool in its expected milling orientation.Based on the specifiedBlade Stock,Tilt Angle,Allowancefor gouge prevention, and compensation for smoothing, the system attempts to use the defined tool to mill the entire part.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/turbomachinery-milling-with-nx-cam-part-2-roughing,"Turbomachinery Milling with NX CAM Part 2, Roughing","OverviewThis is article 2 of a 3 part series that describes the steps and considerations for milling a multi-bladed part using NX CAM Turbomachinery Milling.Part 1 - SetupPart 2 - RoughingPart 3 - FinishingCreated with NX 7.5DetailsStep 1 – Specify the stockOn the cutting parameters dialog open the ‘Stock’ tab and key in the blade and hub stocks:Blade stock– stock to leave on the blades, blends and splitter(s).Hub stock– stock to leave on the hub.Step 2 – Specify the drive methodSet theCut Pattern:Zig / Zig Zag with Lifts.Set theStepover.Note that this is a maximum value based on the largest distance between outer passes. Increasing the extensions may add milling passes.SpecifyStart Point– select between the 6 arrows on the graphic area:Set theCut Direction. Note that the available cut direction options are sensitive to the selections done forCut Patternand forStart Point.Press the “Display” button to generate the preview. Note that preview requires the operation to have the tool defined and all geometries selected. WithCut Levelsset to ""offsets from shroud"" the preview is displayed on the shroud level since most likely the hub level is trimmed and doesn’t represent the real milling pattern.Estimate the results: Note that the preview seen here is influenced also by definitions done in other dialogs, yet it provides a good feedback to define the controls included here.Trimmed tool path means the tool cannot fit in at all regions.To avoid that you may want to do one or more of the following changes:Tool Axisdialog – change “Rotate about” option  “Part axis” to “Blade” and / or decrease the tilt clearance angle.Cutting Parametersdialog – decreaseBlade Stock, decreasePart Safe Clearance, change theAxis Smoothing %and theMax Blade Roll Angle.Change tool and / or cut levels.“Crossing paths” are not necessarily bad. Remember that the tool path displays tool tips, but the contact point moves around depending on tool tilting. The tool tip locations may cross each other while the contact points with the hub are as expected.Based on the blank material knowledge set theTangential ExtensionsandRadial Extensionsto provide full coverage.Tangential Extension= 50%Tool;Radial Extension= 0% toolTangential Extension= 100%Tool;Radial Extension= 100% toolNote not to set values larger than needed for each.You can control the snip point, which determines where the cutting motions driven by the surrounding blades end and the extensions start. The default “Blade Edge Point” is set to “Along Blade Direction” which is appropriate for most cases. To get further control it can be changed to “Along Part Axis” which requires also a “Distance” setting. Different options are (crudely :-) sketched in the following images:Along Blade DirectionAlong Part Axis,Distance= 0Along Part Axis,Distance= D“Blade Edge Point” definition is common to the leading and trailing edges, however, in case of “Along Part Axis” the“Distance”can be set apart for the trailing edge and for the leading edge. Same value is used for the right side and for the left side.Step 3 – Specify the Cut LevelsWhen invoking this dialog you can immediately see the expected cut levels spacing as triangles dynamic preview.Set the required depth mode:Offsets from hub- each cut level is created on constant offset surface patch from the hub. In this case the depth of cut is constantOffsets from shroud- each cut level is created on constant offset surface patch from the shroud. In this case the depth of cut is constant as the lower cut levels reach the hub, the passes are not trimmed, but rather extended along the hub to perform passes connections outside the impeller.Interpolate from shroud to hub– The hub level and the shroud level are interpolated to determine intermediate cut levels. In this case the depth of cut varies along the pass.Set theRange Depth.Automaticwould span the cut levels across the whole depth to be milled, whileSpecifyallows you to determine the number of cuts to be milled.ForOffsets From HuborOffsets From Shroudthe system will generate the specified number of cuts spaced by the depth per cut distance, while forInterpolate From Shroud to Hubthe given number of cuts is equally spaced across the whole depth to be milled.Forinterpolate from shroud to hubthe user can limit the cut volume by changing theStart %(highest cut level) and theEnd %(Lowest cut level).Press theDisplaybutton to generate the preview. The preview here shows the cut levels as distributed along the blades and splitter(s). Change parameters as needed to get proper results previewed. Note that this preview also shows the passes extensions on the higher cut levels, so you may want to switch to the drive method dialog to fine tune some parameters there.Step 4 – Specify the tool axis orientationThe tool axis orientation is controlled by the settings in theAutomatic Tool Axis Orientationdialog and theTool Axis Controltab of the cutting parameters.In theAutomatic Tool Axis Orientationdialog:Tilt Clearance Angle- controls the minimal allowed deviation between the tool and the blades / splitters:Tilt Angle= 0 degTilt Angle= 10 degLead / Lag Angleat Leading and Trailing Edges- can be used to prevent heal digging. In case of Zig Zag, inclination changes with direction change. “Rotate About” controls the method the operation uses to tilt away from potential collisions.Rotation About Part Axisuses the part axis as base for tilting.Rotation About Bladeuses the pass direction as the rotation axis.Rotation About Part Axisis expected to provide a steadier tool axis behavior, while theRotation About Bladeis expected to succeed in case of tight conditions and blades highly twisted around the part axis.In theTool Axis Controltab of theCutting Parametersdialog:Maximum Blade Roll Angle- controls how much can the tool be tilted attempting to lean toward the blade.Maximum Blade Roll Angle= 30 degMaximum Blade Roll Angle= 0 degNote that reducing this value prevents the tool from leaning towards the blade:Maximum Blade Roll Angle= 30 degMaximum Blade Roll Angle= 0 degStep 5– Other Cutting ParametersPath Smoothing %- this controls the smoothing of the passes ahead of splitters leading edge. TheSmoothingslider smooths out the orientation changes. Note that for some cases highSmoothing%may prevent the system from finding gouge free orientation (this will trim the cutting motions). With some special geometries, as the tool approaches the edge it may be tilted to excessive orientations without real need. User can set aDistance From the Edgewhere the tool orientation will freeze and be reused for rest of the segment to the edge.Path Smoothing %= 0Path Smoothing %= 30Blank Stock– inflates the blank or the IPW.Shroud Stock– offsets the shroud to control the higher cut levels. Negative value causes the highest cut level to start deeper below the shroud. Positive values are not supported initially, but when implemented will add cut levels above the shroud.Blade StockandHub Stock– minimum allowed remaining stocks on the blade and hub respectively.Blade Stockvalue is used for all blades, blade blends, splitters, blend splitters and check geometries. In some cases where the outer passes are hazy setBlade Stock≠Hub Stock.Part Safe Clearance– set additional clearance from the holder to the part and check geometries. Note the in case of tight geometries this value should be minimized. This is especially true for cases where a portion of the tool is described as holder (i.e. the cylindrical portion of a taper tool).Step 6– Blank considerationIf blank was defined in one of the geometry groups the operation inherits from it will be considered. That means the same motions are initially calculated, but all motions where the tool is not touching the blank are trimmed.Non-Cutting Moves (NCMs)are used to connect across the gaps. In theCutting Parametersdialog user can select to consider3D IPWinstead ofInitial Blank. That means that an internal simulation is used to calculate the IPW state after all previous operations milled the initial blank. In this case the user can further control:Minimum Material Removed,Hookup Distance, andMinimum Cut Length– a cutting motion smaller than this values is neglectedThis is also the order these parameters are considered (so small gaps are hooked up before removing small segments). Blank consideration is optional. In the classic case where the blank is initially turned to the shroud level, having the blank defined will increase the generation time without changing the result. Blank is needed only if one of the next operations uses3D IPWconsideration. IPW calculation is time consuming. To save time on next regenerations it is recommended to set “Save IPW Model” in theManufacturing Preferences/Geometry/In Process Porkpiecemenu.Step 7– Non Cutting Motions (NCMs)AllNon Cutting Motionsoptions and controls are identical to rest of the operations. Every connection between leading and trailing edges is considered “Between Region.” Connections from one cut level to the next is controlled by theRegion Distanceas long as it is done on the same edge. A new option“Smooth”traverse type was added in NX 7.5. Though available for all operations, it is very effective using it with the family of these of operations.Step 8– First cut feed rate First pass at each cut level is a slotting pass.In theFeeds and Speedsdialog the user can set a slowerFirst Cutfeed rate for this slotting motion. In case one or more splitters exist, the first pass at each segment is controlled by theFirst Cutfeed rate. Visualize these first cuts using theEdit Display/Path Display Colorsand set the color of theFirst Cutmotions to be different than theCutmotions.Step 9- Generation results assessmentAfter generation use theVerify Tool Pathto assess the results. Being a cut level-based operation it is recommended to use the ‘Current Level’display, and to check the ‘Pause at Each Level’.This way you can navigate between levels using thebuttons.Visualizethe tool path to see if all levels are completely cut, if changes to the extensions or other controls need to be done.Visualizethe tool motions to see if tool axis control parameters are set properly. Additionally, theOperation NavigatorprovidesGouge Checkcapabilities as a MB3 option for the operation.Step 10- InstancingProgrammers are expected to program the these cuts just once, for a single blade/splitter sequence. Tool paths are then re-used, or ""instanced"" around the hub as needed. There are a few ways to accomplish this:Using theOperation Navigator,Object/Transformfor this operationLet the post processor process the operations as Macros. NX outputs the macro code needed for this as part of these operation types, so the post can make the ""define as Macro"" code, followed by the several ""use Macro"" codes.Output the G-code once and then manipulate instances using the controller. For example the operator could simply index a rotary axis and rerun the cuts as needed.  This is the most manual method.In the case that the machinists desire to cut in a sequence that roughs, then finishes one level at a time before roughing deeper (sometimes a requirement for thin blades), the instancing of these operations needs to account for this sequence preference. These operations are level-based, and so have a level marker at each level. This enables the post to process these where N levels are cut at once, than in the next instance same N levels are cut and so on till N levels are cut all around. Than next N levels are cut in the first instance and so on. (Note that NX 9 includes specific support for cutting these kinds of rough/finish sequences without resorting to such post processor gymnastics.)Hub FinishHub Finishis actually the lowest cut level out of the rouging operation, so all steps described for the roughing are identical for theHub Finishexcepting step 3 – cut levels and step 6 – blank consideration. Also,Hub Finishdoes not require shroud geometry as input.Hub Finishcovers only the hub and not the blends. In case opposing blends touch (overlap) each not leaving space for the hub, this portion will not be finished and non-cutting moves (NCMs) will connect the gap.Do you have a question?Click 'Add a Comment' below to ask it.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/nx8-5-shop-docs-common-questions-and-answers,NX8.5 Shop Docs Common Questions and Answers,"OverviewDocumenting the manufacturing plan and the specifics of the NC program are important pieces of the part manufacturing process. This Tech Tip covers several Questions and Answers regarding Shop Documentation in NX CAM.Created with NX 8.5DetailsSeven questions about Shop Documentation customization are compiled here:How do I find the MOM variable that corresponds to a particular user input?How can I combine mom variables to get a sum total?I get the following error message. What does it mean?How do you output Shop Docs as a Microsoft Word doc?Does Shop Docs support any version of Excel prior to Excel 2007?Can the Postprocess dialog still be used to create shop Documentation?How do I find a MOM variable for operation machining time that is not listed on sheet 2 of the OOTB template?Question:How do I find the MOM variable that corresponds to a particular user input? For example, I would like to output theStepover Maximum Distancein my shop documentation. How do I find the MOM variable that corresponds toMaximum Distance?Answer:In NX, edit an operation (i.e. Cavity Mill) that contains the user input in the dialog box.Key in a unique, identifiable value such as1.2345:3. ClickOKto finish editing the operation.4. With the operation highlighted in the Operation Navigator, selectShop Documentation.5. In the Shop Documentation dialog box, select the desired Report Format (template), set theReview TooltoOn.6. ClickOKto generate Shop Doc output.7. Close the NX Post Debug lister dialog.8. Go to the directory where the part file is saved.9. In that directory, open the newest *_debug.outfile in a text editor (sort by Date Modified).10. Do a search for the text string1.234and you will find:11. The MOM variable you will need to use in your customized template ismom_stepover_distance.Question:How can I combine mom variables to get a sum total?Answer:To add, for example, tool length and shank length and output in the tool list select template:The syntax is:'= ${mom_tool_length} + ${mom_tool_tapered_shank_length}The calculation is done only when the html output is displayed in Excel.Question:I get the following error message. What does it mean?Answer:It means you had an output window displayed when attempting to create another output. Close the displayed output window(s) before generating another output.Question:How do you output Shop Docs as a Microsoft Word doc?Answer:For .txt output, change the file extension to .doc. Just create a .txt file and in a explorer window change the extension to .doc – then double click.For html output viewed in Excel, save as .xlsx file. Open in Word and save as .docx.Question:Does Shop Docs support any version of Excel prior to Excel 2007?Answer:As we provided our templates in .xlsx, Shop Docs only supports Excel 2007 and later.Question:Can the Postprocess dialog still be used to create shop Documentation?Answer:No.Question:How do I find a MOM variable for operation machining time that is not listed on sheet 2 of the OOTB template?Answer:Sheet 2 is anincompletelist of MOM variables. While sheet 2 lists the most commonly used MOM variables, all MOM variables that Shop Docs uses can be referenced by using theReview Toolor found by searching thedebug.outfile.1. Select an operation (referred to as a “member” in the Review Tool) in the Operation Navigator and selectShop Documentation.2. In the Shop Documentation dialog box, select the desired Report Format (template), set theReview TooltoOn:3. ClickOKto generate Shop Doc output.In the NX Post Debug lister dialog, click on an event in the first column to list the associated MOM variables in the second column. You might be able to find the desired MOM variable using this “hunt & peck” method, but searching thedebug.outfile for the desired MOM variable is easier. Do this:4. Go to the directory where the part file is saved.5. In that directory, open the newest*_debug.outfile in a text editor (sort by Date Modified).6. Do a search for the wordtimeand you will find:Var: mom_toolpath_time = 94.71146749849486900This value equates to the Time listed in the Operation Navigator for the selected member or members. It is the NX operation machining time as opposed to the postprocessor machining time.7. If you scroll up you will see that this variable is listed under Event 5: MOM_MEMBERS_HDRThis is the event inside the NX Post Debug Lister in which you will find the variables of the member (operation) you selected.8. Copymom_toolpath_timeinto your customized Shop Docs template.Additional Notes:UGII_CAM_SHOP_DOC_DIRenvironment variable determines where the Shop Doc function looks for files.Note:Turn this variable off by typing in some character (i.e.”X”) to make the variable invalid. Then by default, it will referenceU:/wnti32/nx080_phasexx/MACH/resource/shop_doc/excel_templates2. In the production environment, the Excel files used to create the Excel-html templates are stored in:C:\Program Files\Siemens\NX 8.5\MACH\resource\shop_doc3. Theshopdoc_excel.tclfile inside the excel_templates folder specifies where Shop Docs will look for the excel.exe file. Example:Be sure this path is correct for your installation if you have Excel. If it does not find Excel (or if you don’t have it), then the output will be displayed by the HTML browser only.4.

Shopdocs is supported in Teamcenter. However:When running in managed mode, Shop Documentation output must be checked intoTeamcenter9.0or later. Shop documentation files will not import correctly into a pre-9.0 version of Teamcenter.You can open HTML output generated from new templates in TC9.1 by double-clicking the HTML output icon inside the Manufacturing Activities tab. In TC9.0, you must open the HTML output using the TC Navigator.All old (pre-NX8) templates work with TC just as they did in NX7.5.9. Obsolete TemplatesThe Postprocess dialog will no longer be used to create Shop Documentation.  The following templates will be commented out of the Postprocessor list:Note:If you want to use pre-NX 8 templates, remove the comment sign (#) in the shop_doc.dat file . The file is located in MACH\resource\shop_doc.11. Printing and Page FormattingThe Excel template provides minimal configurable options to help you specify the content length of each page.The numeric input field next to PAGE CONTENT LENGTH determines the distance between the Page :  ${cur_page}  of  ${total_pages} markers in the .html output.  The value must be a positive real number.If the value is “0” or empty, the content will be output without pagination. That is, “Page:  1 of 1” will appear at the top of the output and no other markers will follow it.If the value you enter is greater than 0 but less than the title block length (distance between TITLE START and the first TABLE START markers)and REPEAT TITLE is set to Yes, then minimum length between markers is the title block + 1 table row. This assures that the title block plus 1 successive table row will appear on each page.If the value is greater than 0 but less than the title block length (distance between ###TITLE START### and the first ###TABLE START### markers),and REPEAT TITLE is set to No, then the minimum length between markers is the title block. This assures that the title block will appear on the first page followed by a continuous table on subsequent pages.Do you have a question?Click 'Add a Comment' below to ask it.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/a-practical-approach-to-identify-feeds-and-speeds-settings-for-peak-and-stable-high-speed-machining-performance,A practical approach to identify feeds and speeds settings for peak and stable high-speed machining performance,"Executive SummaryOne of the major challenges an NC programmer faces every day is identifying critical machining parameters, such as depth of cut, step over, spindle speed and feed rate. Traditionally, the starting point for this data has been either a machining data handbook or the experience of senior machinists on the floor. In a majority of cases, this data is very conservative and/or outdated. When problems arise, the usual recourse is to reduce one or more critical machining parameters. These remedies invariably reduce the metal removal rate (MRR). While this may have been acceptable in the past, today’s highly competitive die/mold machining market is forcing users to push the limits of productivity.The widespread application of high-speed machines in the past several years necessitates a fresh look at how things are done on the shop floor. Simply increasing the spindle speed and feed and decreasing the chip-load significantly do not constitute high speed machining. To reap the benefits of significant investments in high-speed machine tools and accessories, NC programmers need to optimize and reach the safe limits of the system.FIGURE 1: Two cuts showing stable and chatter machining conditions.This article discusses the relationship between critical machining parameters and high speed machining. It introduces a new process that stresses the importance of obtaining cutting data for high speed milling applications. This method follows the theory of chatter and leverages stability lobe diagrams to suggest a practical no-cost implementation.Unstable machining results in poor and wavy surface finishes that many people associate with the pinging noise of chatter. A new methodology leverages these simple characteristics to identify optimum spindle speeds and cutter loads for any given tool, holder, machine and workpiece material combination. In essence, this method cuts a number of Z level passes at varying spindle speeds to identify stable machining conditions.A series of identical passes are made on an inclined face of a test block, as in Figure 2. Each pass is performed at increasing spindle speed and feed, maintaining the same chip load for all passes. Listening to cuts and inspecting the surface finish of each pass can identify stable-cutting conditions.FIGURE 2: NX software screen shot showing Z level cuts on the test piece.Each horizontal line in Figure 3 shows a series of Z level passes at increasing spindle speeds. The parallel lines, as they go up, indicate increasing metal removal rates. The vertical lines indicate how you can find the limits at each identified stable pindle speed.The trial conditions and cutting pass results are plotted in a stability lobe diagram (Figure 3). Based on the diagram and simple equations, the material removal rate (MRR) for each spindle speed and depth of cut combination can be calculated. Operating the system at peak MRR, and within safe and stable limits, ensures optimum utilization of machining equipment.FIGURE 3: Trial cutting conditions shown on a stability lobe diagram.A newly proposed processA newly proposed alternative was put into practice on a Makino V33. In this instance, a 10mm diameter Jabro Tornado Ball end Mill was analyzed. The length of the tool was set at 30mm on an HSK holder. A P20 workpiece measuring 82mm in length, 65mm in width and 48mm in height was used as a test piece. A 30-degree taper was cut on one side of the block toaccommodate the holder and to view each cut distinctly.For this example, assume a depth of cut equal to approximately 30 percent of the tool diameter. If there are other considerations limiting the load on the tool, follow the lesser one. Make sure the tool creates clear cusps to distinguish one depth from another. The height of the block should accommodate at least 12 depths of cut. The slope on the cutting side should clear the tool holder. The length of the block should be sufficient to hang off the vise to allow at least 10 side passes. The width should be sufficient to be able to see the cuts.Pickup up relevant data from the tool catalog* Refers to alternative tools in the tool selection table.* * In case of melting of the plastic, reduce the cutting speed (in case of high wear as a result of added elements, reduce the cutting speed).* Refers to alternative tools in the tool selection table.Figure 4: Tables showing manufacturer's recommended cutting data.The tool manufacturer provides two very important pieces of information: the maximum cutting speed and the chip load. The maximum cutting speed depends on the type of coating on the tool and the maximum temperature it can safely withstand. The chip load (feed/tooth) is based on the material and the geometry of the tool tip.According to the accompanying table, the maximum cutting speed is 280mm/min and the chip load is 0.072mm/teeth. This example assumed side rough milling conditions for the trial.In order not to violate the maximum cutting speed, you need to stay below 9000 rpm.(Note: This can be increased for finishing conditions.)Maximum_RPM = (Max_Cutting_Speed_in_mm/min) / (π*Tool_Diameter)Maximum_RPM = (280*103) / (π*10) = 8912 ≈ 9000Narrowing the trial rangeFor these trials, the spindle speed was varied from 6000 to 11500 at intervals of 500 rpm. The maximum rpm was increased to keep the results applicable to finishing conditions as well. The depth of cut for each Z level cut was 4mm. The program as manually edited to reflect the changing spindle speed at each cut level.Keeping a constant chip loadThe feed was correspondingly adjusted to maintain constant feed/teeth throughout the trial.Feed_mm/min = Feed_per_Teeth * Number_of_Teeth * RPMMachiningAn initial cut with a 0.5mm side stepover was cut on the slope. The side stepover was adjusted on the X offset register of the machine. This eliminates the need for a new program for each cycle.The initial cut with 0.5mm stepover was repeated once again to allow similar starting conditions for each cycle. This cut produced stable cutting conditions throughout the slope. (Some of the cuts were dull at the bottom of the cusp due to decreased cutting speed.)The stepover was increased to 1mm and the cycle was repeated. Even though the stability lobe diagram predicts stable-machining conditions at all spindle speeds, very low chatter signals were noticed at both extremes of the spindle speed. This process was repeated with increasing stepover values until severe chatter signals were noticed at 2mm. This cycle clearly showed stable cutting at 7000 rpm and 9500 rpm.The stepover was progressively increased all the way to 3mm. The cuts at 7000 and 9500 rpm remained stable.The resultsThe part in Figure 5 shows stable and unstable machining conditions. This indicates a 4mm depth of cut and 3mm side step. Notice that the third and eighth steps indicate clean cuts at 7000 rpm and 9500 rpm.FIGURE 5: The final proof.Note: The stability lobe diagram shown in Figure 6 was computed for the same tool/holder/machine set up. Notice that the actual behavior follows the general predicted pattern but the actual numbers are off by around 1000 rpm.FIGURE 6: Stability lobe diagram.ConclusionThe stability lobe diagram is a useful tool for identifying stable cutting conditions at varying spindle speeds and MRRs (material removal rates). The diagram can be used to find the maximum allowable MRR, a key performance indicator for machining efficiency, for a given spindle speed. It is important to note that stable machining can be achieved at any RPM, but at the cost of MRR. A global view of the stability lobe diagram, either computed with chatter prediction hardware tools or by the method prescribed in this article, helps users achieve high MRRs at certain stable RPMs.Reducing speed may not be the most efficient remedy for chatterIn many cases, when chatter is encountered, machinists tend to reduce spindle speed to eliminate chatter. While this technique will result in a stable cutting condition, it may not be the most efficient. Instead, it is often possible to increase the spindle speed, which will eliminate chatter, while also improving cutting efficiency.In the diagram below, slight chatter is encountered at Point A (8,000 rpm with 2.0mm side step over). Outside of re-programming the part with a smaller step over, there are two easy options to remedy the chatter, either decrease or increase the spindle speed. Because the lobe diagram clearly illustrates that a stable cutting condition can be achieved by increasing the spindle speed, this is best option because it is more efficient.FIGURE 7: An increase in spindle speed results in stable cutting condition and improved machining efficiency.Machining at higher speeds  may not be the most efficientOften times, when using high speed machines, the inclination is to run the machine at its top permissible speed. While chatter free conditions can be achieved at extreme speeds, the machining efficiency as measured by the MRR (material removal rate) can be quite low.Material_Removal_Rate = Feed_rate_mm/min * Depth_of_Cut_mm * Side_Step_Over_mmIn the diagram below, stable cutting is achieved at 11,500 rpm with 0.5mm side step over (Point A). Because the spindle is running at a high rpm, it is quite common to assume that the system is performing efficiently. However, as illustrated in the lobe diagram, this is not the case. Point B, a much slower rpm but with a greater depth of cut results in nearly six times greater machining efficiency.FIGURE 8: Stable machining at a slower rpm with a greater depth of cut is much more efficient than machining at a much higher rpm with a lighter depth of cut.Usage notesFollow practical, repeatable conditions (for example, tighten the collet-holder with the same torque every time). This needs to be repeated for every tool/holder/machine combination. While this sounds like a lot, it can easily pay off.The sweet spots are transferable to other workpiece materials directly. The corresponding maximum depth of cut and stepover values will vary.You could replace the tool with a similar replacement tool from the same manufacturer. The results are still valid. It is true for holders as well.Reset the tool length as close as possible to the testing conditions.You could increase the depth of cut while decreasing the stepover correspondingly and vice-versa.Do not use this data on thin walled parts since the natural frequency of the part being machined changes during the machining process.Do you have a question?Click 'Add a Comment' below to ask it.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/operation-navigator-benefits,Operation Navigator benefits,"This Tech Tip illustrates several key features of the Operation Navigator and shows how to make the best use of this powerful feature.This Tech Tip was created with NX 8.5DetailsThe Operation Navigator is the utility in NX CAM used to create, modify and manage your NC operations.The utility offers a very effective way to manage the NC operation in 4 different views, such that it becomes easy for the programmer to categorize the operations, the tools used, tolerance settings etc.The four views are:Program Order ViewTool Order ViewGeometry ViewMethod ViewAn advantage of the 4 views is the inter-linking of the views, such that the operations or objects created under each different view can share the information stored where needed, which helps in effective way of programming and reducing the programming effort.Geometry ViewThis is the view where we create our geometry types likeMCS,WORKPIECE-Parts/BlankandCheckGeometries,Cut Area, andBoundary Geometriesetc.Objects created here, or for that matter in any viewing group, follow the parent and child relationship, as indicated by the level of indent. Any child (more indented) object will inherit the properties applied in parent (less indented) object.As seen in the image above,MCS_MILLis the object at the top level in the navigator tree and theWORKPIECEobject is created as a child object the below theMCS_MILL, and so on forMILL_AREAand the operation.So going up from NC operation level, the operation (i.e.ZLEVEL_5AXIS_1) is inheriting the area to be machined from its parentMILL_AREA, which further is inheriting thePartandBlankgeometries from theWORKPIECEobject. And finally, all of these are inheriting theOffsetvalue from theMCS_MILL.Any tool path operation created under theMILL_AREA, will be inheriting the values specified in all the parent groups above it in the navigator tree. This reduces the effort in programming by enabling us to defineMCSandGeometriesonly once and any number of tool paths created will automatically know the inputs from inheritance properties.Also NX offers the flexibility to move an operation from oneGeometrygroup to another, just by drag & drop functionality. When an operation is moved to a new geometry parent, it changes its inheritance values automatically. As we see in above image theDrillingoperation is created under theWORKPIECEobject, so it will not inherit theCut Area, which could be different for this drilling operation, but it will still inherit thePart GeometriesandMCSOffsetvalues which need to be same.With this functionality, NX offers a very easy way to avoid duplicating the effort of specifying the same parameters again and again. It is also a very flexible way to manage operations in different geometry groups for different inheritance requirements.Machining Method ViewInMethodview the user can categorize the operations depending on the machining method likeRoughing,Semi-Finishing,Finishingetc. Of course, users may create as many different Methods as needed to conveniently provide inherited parameters for their particular machining process steps.There are several cutting parameters that tend to be distinct for these different Methods, so specifying them once as a Method parent allows several operations to inherit these parameters in the same way that Geometry specifications are inherited. Parameters that can be inherited from a parent Method include: part stock, tolerances, feeds, etc.As seen in the image above theZLEVEL_5AXIS_1operation is placed underMILL_FINISHmethod, so the operation will inherit the values specified in the parent group, and so on for any additional child operations under this parent Method.In this case, parameters likeStock,Intol/Outtol, andFeedswill be transferred to the operations placed under any specific Method group. As seen in image below.Machine Tool ViewSame function of Inheritance and parent child relation is applied in theMachine Toolview; here users can manage the tools used for groups of operations. Any number of operations created with the same tool can be arranged and seen under the same tool parent in the navigator tree.As seen in the image below, both theZ-leveloperations are using same tool and hence are placed under the same tool parent. Also here the operation will inherit the properties of ‘Tool Number,Tool Length RegisterandCut-com Register’, from thePocket_01, based on inheritance principle.Program Order ViewTheProgram Orderview shows the sequence of the operations as they will actually run on machine tool. This sequence also is the key to calculating the level basedIn-process Work-piece(IPW) results for any operations that follow a level-basedIPWoperation within that group.Besides just specifying the actual cut order, another advantage of theProgram Orderview is that users can create and manage the NC operation in the groups as suited to the specific job.As an example if the job needs to be machined in 2 different setups and the user needs to manage the operations for both setups, we can createSetup_1andSetup_2Program Groupparents and locate the NC operations inside the respective Program Groups.This approach helps manageme several operations and avoids any confusion.Interlinking the viewsWe have gone through the individual advantage and usage of different views of operation navigator. Now let’s go through some advantages of inter-linking of these views.One advantage of these groups is that the NC operation placed and located while creating new operation, under the required fields considerably reduces the program time and effort as all the important required parameter are fulfilled, i.e. theToolis inherited fromToolandPocketobjects inTool View,Geometryis inherited fromGeometrygroups in theGeometry View, andStock,ToleranceandFeedare inherited from theMethodsin theMethod View. Once the parameters in these groups are correctly defined, the only major job for the programmer is to justGeneratethe operation.See the image below - the Location block lets you select all of these parents as you wish, right when you create a new operation.Another major advantage is the automatic set up of cutting data, which is based onTool Material,Part Material, andMethod(likeRoughing,Semi-FinishingorFinishing), and these values are inherited by the operation simply by locating the operation under requiredGroupsin different views.User Interface of Operation NavigatorNX displays some very important information needed while programming right in theOperation Navigator. This information can be accessed and seen up front, without opening the individual operation dialogs, as seen in the image below. We can see theToolused,Path Status,Time,Methodused.User can customize the information columns by right mouse button click in empty space in the Operation Navigator. Choose Columns, and check or un-check options as you choose to make the up-front information environment more suitable to your needs.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/reduce-clicks-during-cut-area-selection,Reduce clicks during Cut Area selection,"This Tech Tip shows some helpful shortcuts for selecting lots of geometry.Selecting cut areas manually, either in operations directly or in Mill_Areas etc, is pretty easy when there aren't many surfaces.But when you need to select several 100 surfaces or have features which you see again and again, the following will show you a few tricks on how to limit your clicks and make the cut area selection easier.This Tech Tip was created with NX version 8.5Details: Selection by colorUsing color selection of course requires that you have different colors on your part, reflecting either features or certain part areas.The colors can come directly from the CAD team, or you can add them in the CAM process.Steps:In theSpecify Cut Areadialog, open theFilter Methodsdrop down list and chooseMore...ClickTypebutton and selectFace, then clickOKClickColorIf you know the Color ID number, input it in theIDfield and pressEnteron your keyboard.If you do not know the Color ID number, you can clickInherit From Objectand select one of the part surfaces with the color you want to have selected.ClickOKuntil you are back at theCut AreadialogClickSelect AllNow your surfaces have all been selected.Details: Selection by face NAMEUsing face NAME selection requires that you have face names on your part, reflecting either features or certain part areas. The names can come directly from the CAD team, or you can add them in the CAM process.Steps:In theSpecify Cut Areadialog, input the name in theNamefieldPressEnteron your keyboardNow your surfaces have all been selected.Additional informationYou can reduce the user clicks even further by creating macros that assist you during the cut area selection process. To have a fully automatic macro without user interaction, it requires that either your colors or names are identical every time. Meaning you need to decide on a standard for your parts/features. If you are not able to decide on a standard, you can create macros with user-interaction.The user action could in that case either be:Adding the color ID numberChoosing the color by inheriting from objectInputting the name in the name field.Or similar…Do you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/how-to-use-generic-motion-to-fully-control-tool-paths,How to use Generic Motion to fully control tool paths,"Sometimes its easier (and faster) to get the toolpath you want by taking direct control of your tool's motion to define specific moves. This webinar shows a couple of examples of how Generic Motion can be used to take direct control of your tool paths.DetailsGeneric Motion is a programming method in NX CAM that provides on-screen graphical interaction to let you easily position the cutting tool to create tool paths for machines with five axes of freedom or less. Generic Motion provides these capabilities:On-screen graphical interaction (dynamic handles) to define tool position and orientationBuild tool paths from a selection of linear, circular, and rotary motion elementsMaintain associativity for tool path updatesSupport for milling and drilling toolsDo you have a question?Post your questions or comments at the bottom of this Tech Tip.
