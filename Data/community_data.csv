If you do not have a custom_dirs.dat file in your environment, you will need to add it. If you already have this file defined in your custom environment, skip to step 3 below.1) Create an empty text file named custom_dirs.dat in a location where you keep your custom NX environment related files.2) In whichever manner you set environment variables for your custom NX environment, set the environment variable UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE to the full path of the file which you created.3) Download the 7z file attached to this post and extract it using 7-zip to a location where you keep your custom NX environment related files. The location of this folder should be one which has no spaces in the path (no higher level folders can have names with spaces in them).4) Copy the path of the PostConfiguratorLibrarySourceTool folder. This is the folder containing the startup and application folders.5) Edit the custom_dirs.dat file in your favorite text editor and paste the copied path to a new line in the file. There should be no spaces or double quotes in this path. (Environment variables may be used in this path if you prefer to use them and are familiar with how to use them.)6) Save the custom_dirs.dat file.7) Start a new NX session with your custom environment.Once a new session of NX is started with the changes made, you should find a button has been added to the dropdown within the Manufacturing application of NX.","KJH thanks for sharing. ||| Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) I have updated this to the 5.5.8 version.

I noticed there is a difference with this download attached and the download of the PC library tool from the post hub resources page.  This download has a .dll vs the .exe as the startup file.  We have a .grb file tied to a .rtb file in the startup folder vs a .men file.  It seems the .dll needs to be there to work in the .grb file.  Since the post hub files come down with a .exe to use this procedure I need to use your .dll that is included in this download.  I get this message now in NX2312.  Will you be updating this .dll as NX versions are released so this message won't keep coming up?  I presume at some point the .dll will need updating anyway.  For some reason the .exe cannot be used in my .grb file as i get a message about an unknown action but the .dll works.  See attached pics 1167 and 1168 for using the .dll and .exe respectively.  I can create an on the fly custom command button while in NX and can add the .exe.  Is it not possible to use the .exe in these group and menu files?  Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) I do intend to keep this updated as I learn of the updates.  In response to your .dll vs .exe questions, you do need to have a .dll for the menuscript files. On the bright side, the .dll and .exe are the same file. Just rename the .exe to .dll. This is exactly what I did when packaging this tool, along with creating the files to add the button to the UI. ||| Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) I do intend to keep this updated as I learn of the updates.

I downloaded a step file from Sandvik, but I'm struggling with the steps to prepare the model before setting it up in the tool library.The step file is downloaded as an assembly but when I import it into NX, NX creates the individual models and a blank assembly.Can anyone please explain the steps for importing a step file and getting it ready for creation within the tool library 🙂Thank you.","Mike_R If you subscribe to the CoroPlus Tool Library you get an ad in for NX that will import the GTC package without making any ModelsThis takes the model you created and adds to your tool library in NX. In addition your CoroPlus Tool Library stores your assemblies so they are always available if you need for a different user or Different CAM software. The same GTC package can be imported into Vericut. ||| ady35843060 Ah! I will try this. this issue I'm having is when I import a stp, in the assembly created by NX there are no solid bodies. which I need for the tool library to see. But then the individual parts of the assembly which NX also creates are created as a body.I have been on YouTube all day:) I'm so confused. Edge cam was much simpler lol Thanks!! ||| ady35843060 This is what I'm trying to achieve. ||| Mike_R When you import Step files you are using them to match a parametric tool in NX which has never been very easy to get exact.

However, the B-axis value is currently outputting as 0. I used Post Configurator. How can I configure it to output the rotation value?","Steve Curtis Set your MCS as Main and align it with the machine axis. Then NX will output the rotation as B270. for the work on the side of the part as you have shown. Currently your MCS is not aligned with the machine axis. JIKYUNG Hi  The MCS structure is as follows.

Who can help me?and What does Orientation Status mean?I tried post-processing with Drill, Deep, and BreakChip, but the output was G74. Why?thanks!","KJH Hello Joe, The ""Orientation Status"" is found in the NX Documentation in the following doc... https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20230425446868577.xid615615/xid1971986  Orientation Status Specifies the spindle orientation. Orientation Available when you select theOrientation Statuscheck box. Lets you specify the spindle orientation in degrees.  Your postprocessor is controlling the output of G74. Are you using Post Builder or Post Configurator?  With Best Regards, Kevin  joe han hi！Kevin I can understand the meaning of Orientation Status, but I'm not sure what purpose it has in Tapping. ​ I am using Post Builder,and I am learning these four types of tapping Cycles. Can you tell me what are the differences between each of these four Cycles. thank you for you help！  ToonVDK Hi Joe,  The Orientation represents the angle to which the control positions the tool before machining the thread. This allows you to re-cut the thread, if required.  For example for a Heidenhain it maps to Q336 (Angle for spindle orientation).  The different cycle types link to different machine cycles, for the same Heidenhain you'll have a Cycle 206 TAPPING with a floating tap holder, a Cycle 207 RIGID TAPPING without floating tap holder and a Cycle 209 TAPPING W/ CHIP BRKG without floating tap holder...

Like a colletted tap holder. Deep and break chip are special cycles that is machine specific an perform different actions in the cycle. Deep I am not familiar with but break chip rotates some number of turns forward and then reverses to break the chip and moves forward again.  To get the different G codes out you normally have to define them in your post.  Hope this is somewhat clear to you. joe han thank you！ ||| joe han thank you！"

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D5Vb00000Kc96qKAB/wireframe-turning,Wireframe turning,"Hi all,Another day another question... Again I am new to NX.Q. I have set up a turning environment, as a test I have created some wireframe geom outside the setup, this is something I do a lot when manipulating tool paths during part creation. I'm trying to find the best way to machine this profile as a stand-alone inside my turning set up. On other cam systems used, I'd select the finish turn option and then select the geom I want to turn (Job done). Within NX this seems a struggle.  I can see there is both teach mode and finish profile, after playing with both of the cycles (a lot) I did manage to get a tool path Out of the finish profile and teach mode, but I had to create a turn geom and define stock etc, which seems a massive pain.In summary, what I am trying to achieve is a finished turned profile on wireframe geom without defining stock etc, I'm pretty sure it's my inexperience! What is the easiest way to do this??please help!!!","KJH Hello,  What version of NX are you using?  With Best Regards, Kevin ady35843060 I’m now on the latest version!

Really enjoying the software 👍🤘 thanks again ||| JasonOtto NX turning operations (with the exception of teach mode) are designed to be stock-aware.  They only produce tool path where there is material to remove.  So, no stock defined = no tool path.  That's why your teach mode operation worked to give you a tool path, even though teach mode can be tricky to learn.  You are able to define stock with wireframe as well, just as you did with the part profile.  You can create a new sketch or offset the existing part profile wireframe by a small amount.  Just pick this wireframe in the TURNING_WORKPIECE as the set of blank curves.  then choose Curves:   ||| ady35843060 Ahhh! Thank you I will try this. Yes it does seem to use the stock hence the issues I have had. Just something im not used to. ||| ady35843060 I take it this has to be a closed profile with the curves for the stock? Thanks again. ||| JasonOtto Not necessarily a closed profile unless you are using some sort of hollow or cored out material, but you would want the profile ends to at least meet the centerline axis of the setup so NX can create the spun outlines.  Attached is a sample older job from NX12, so you should be able to open it in any current version and see how this works.  Best of luck! wireframe_turning_mm_NX12 121KB"

I will fully admit to not being extremely well versed in the intricacies of NX instillation management, so I asked my VAR and they never got back to me.  The thing of it is, around here - every NX VAR sets small-scale customers up with NX Custom almost as a default, so one wonders why the heck it isn't an official Siemens product? Or even the default OOTB experience? Why is my (relatively substantial) investment in NX CAD/CAM quasi dependent on thevolunteer effortsof a Siemens employee? ||| Bud Hi Gerrit,  We have several customers waiting for NXcustom 1953 to be available before they implement NX 1953.

The deep hole drilling supports the first/last cut feed rate as you mentioned and does not offer variable feed rate support.  If you’re seeking an automatic or semi-automatic solution, the best approach appears to be the Generic Feature Operation (as you previously attempted). You should aim to make the intersection data accessible within your feature.  You could potentially utilize feature teaching or feature tagging to incorporate the relevant data into your feature and proceed from there.  I will not dive into these options here, instead explore a quick alternative as presented below.  A possible work around (depends on your geometric context) might be to recognize your hole as multiple holes on the same axis (In my example I have reduced the maximum merge factor within customer defaults ->Manufacturing:Geometry->Features to a small value before restarting nx and executing the feature recognition command)  I have grouped these holes into a feature group (ordered top down) and defined a generic feature operation (with Retract Type to None and In Between Feature Transfer to None) that will give me the possibility to get the desired output  The subprogram specifies the conditional movements to be executed if the depth condition ‘i < DEPTH + Tool_Point_Length’ is met (with i being 5, 10, 15, etc.). In this case, the motion will proceed with a custom feedrate defined by ‘i’.   Definition of custom feed rate by expression would have made it possible to define this more optimal/compressed by using a loop construct. Maybe something to consider to enhance.  Thanks,  Toon ||| Burak532320 Hello,  Thanks for reply. With my data its not possible to split holes with ""merge factor"" even with it 0.001. Can we approach this situation on postprocessor side anyway ?  Or any other possibilities for recognize split holes on generic feature operation? Other cam software which can do output what i want has not feature for feedrate variables aswell but they make a macro for postprocessor and its looking for intersections then insert feedrates before the crossover Z points, instead of only output F5 on crossover and F50 after crossover like NX.

Thank you. ||| Reinier Capelle Very good question!  It is all about Application Criteria for Machining Rules. FBM Machining Rules allow you to specify exactly what you want and when.  You will need -at least - 2 machining rules, as Stefan already mentioned. One for roughing with a large tool and one for finishing the corners with a smaller tool.  For example, here is the ootb rule for roughing  where we add an extra application condition:  This rule will now be rejected if the RADIUS is smaller than WIDTH / 5  Then the next lower priority rule will be tried. We add one extra condition: we say that the feature before finishing may have a large RADIUS:   It is up to the tool selection and the available tools which diameter will be chosen for the preceding rouging operation. This finishing rule has Application Criteria based on the (PMI) Surface Roughness. We allow the application also when the Radius is small, by a logical OR   So, this is what needs to be done with the ootb Machining Rules to get a similar result. In a custom rule library it may be a bit different but the idea can be the same.  Applied on the plate part from the tutorials, we get this for the roughing operation: ... and this is the finishing operation:  To follow the reasoning process that lead to the solution, see file TmaRecMethodLog.txt on your %temp% directory."

I have a question  I realised that there is an option to use the ""NXstart_customer.bat"" for any customisations. I have implemented a very basic sync task trigger from our shared network location library to the user's desktop and it works great, sync happens and then the regular NXStart.bat runs as per usual  I was wondering, is there a built in way to introduce a delay in the sequence between the two? Eg: when you run the NXstart shortcut on the users desktop...... NXstart_customer.bat runs....system waits X seconds...then moves on to the regular nxstart.bat?  Trying to allow time for sync completion since our intranet is very slow  If there isn't, perhaps it could be added to considerations of features for any future verisons of NXCustom 😁  I have pasted the snippet of the NXstart_customer.bat in case it is needed for reference   Stefan Pendl You can use the Windows TIMEOUT command. Enter the above command into a command prompt to get the detailed information. tzallas @Stefan Pendl​ thank you for that!  Simpler answer than expected. 😁 I thought the logic in the NXstart.bat would need to consider the delay...had not realised that if you build in a timeout delay in your intial bat it will respect it before moving on 😅  as usual I overthought it. Thank you, I learned something 👍 Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) I would recommend, instead of adding some arbitrary delay where the time you specify could be too much or too little depending on the amount of data being transferred and the network speed, you could just wait for the synchronization to finish before the script continues.  If you are doing something like this:  start """" cmd /c robocopy ...  Consider adding the /wait argument to the start command:  start """" /wait cmd /c robocopy ...  Here is documentation on the start command for reference:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/start  Edit: I came back and read your code since I only skimmed over it before I originally replied. I am curious why you have the sync script on the user's desktop. That aside, I see you are starting the sync script like so:  start """" /b ""%syncfilepath%""  So assuming in that script you are running the robocopy directly, you change the above line to:  start """" /wait /b ""%syncfilepath%""  That, or maybe simply calling the script will work for you instead of starting a separate process:  call ""%syncfilepath%""  Or maybe you could do whatever the sync script is doing, directly in the NXstart_customer.bat and remove the need for the additional script entirely. tzallas Thank you@Eric Magray(Siemens Employee)​  ​ as always very helpful!  TLDR;  I did not intend for this to be a tutorial on basic understanding for bat cmd, script, syntax, parameters for, clearly a super novice user like me, so I appreciate the thoroughness here 😊 I’m swimming in the deep end  Those as are very good and common-sense points and I completely agree with you. If I had it my way I would simply add a user to the CAD group on the AD and the client to our domain and a GPO would take care of all the rest “automagically” and they would be setup However I am hampered by the limitation put on me by our IT department and management so I am trying to zig zag my way passed them whilst making things have some logic and minimal user interaction/tampering and more importantly less repetition for myself  Robocopy Would love to use robocopy since it is built in and much faster than a GUI based free app we are using now. Cmd Thank you for the documentation link, I also did the old ""start /?"" To get some sort of info 😊  ….I am blindly stumbling my way through trying to learn all this as I go, so all info is welcome.  Syncscript it is on the users desktop since that is what I thought logical (?) I would like to have it in one location (server) so I don’t have to push it to all users manually everytime, but Iassumed it has to start on the user desktop so it knows what %userprofile% is? If it started on the server it would assume the %userprofile& of the server?

Thank you, I learned something 👍 ||| Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) I would recommend, instead of adding some arbitrary delay where the time you specify could be too much or too little depending on the amount of data being transferred and the network speed, you could just wait for the synchronization to finish before the script continues.  If you are doing something like this:  start """" cmd /c robocopy ...  Consider adding the /wait argument to the start command:  start """" /wait cmd /c robocopy ...  Here is documentation on the start command for reference:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/start  Edit: I came back and read your code since I only skimmed over it before I originally replied. I am curious why you have the sync script on the user's desktop. That aside, I see you are starting the sync script like so:  start """" /b ""%syncfilepath%""  So assuming in that script you are running the robocopy directly, you change the above line to:  start """" /wait /b ""%syncfilepath%""  That, or maybe simply calling the script will work for you instead of starting a separate process:  call ""%syncfilepath%""  Or maybe you could do whatever the sync script is doing, directly in the NXstart_customer.bat and remove the need for the additional script entirely. tzallas Thank you@Eric Magray(Siemens Employee)​  ​ as always very helpful!

Can anyone assist me?,I would like to know which part of the TCL code handles the XYZ coordinate processing when the tool compensation is turned on and the PB post-processor is running?,"Ryder I feel that it has its own specific processing logic. Because after setting the minimum movement data in the software, the post-processed program will change. Additionally, when I try to use a matrix for coordinate transformation and enable tool compensation, my matrix becomes entirely ineffective. ||| Study Not sure what you have for a background (may know this) but cam processor will supply cl data positions (mom_mcs_goto) and calculated output positions (mom_pos) based on a kinematic setting (by a bunch of other variables.) I am not sure what you mean about ""tool compensation is turned on"" from standpoint of what cam processor does between cl (mom_mcs_goto) and output (mom_pos) but the only way to affect the output that I know of is to set a ""Z Offset"" in the operation which will adjust mom_pos positions.   Ryder Thank you for your response, Study. Your reply seemed to provide me with some inspiration, but it was not sufficient. Perhaps my expression was not clear enough. By 'tool compensation is turned on,' I mean in the software, you should go to 'Tool Axis & CutCom' -> 'Cutter Compensation' -> 'CutCom Location' and select 'All Finish Passes.' This setting will affect the output results.  Study Ok. That is not so much of a postprocessor thing - you are asking about the path the cam processor creates from the operation settings. The postprocessor gets move events where the cam processor has broken down cutter comp moves. It is possible to modify the positions before they are output to program code but in my experience it hasnt been necessary. If you want to change mom_pos positions you can do it in PB_CMD_before_motion (in a typical postbuilder postprocessor.) I am not sure what matrix math is necessary for that but you can do so as needed. You will have a mom_mcs_goto and can turn it into the mom_pos you want. Ryder I see, but that's exactly what I've been doing. However, when the 'CutCom Location' is turned off, all my coordinate transformations are correct. When 'CutCom Location' is set to 'All Finish Passes', the coordinate data becomes incorrect. Perhaps it's not accurate to say ""incorrect""; it would be more appropriate to say that the matrix I've written is no longer effective.   Ryder The first time was due to my incorrect operation, so it's not a concern. The code processed the second time was correct. The code processed the third time was incorrect. Up to ""G01 Y23. F250."" it was still correct. But when it came to ""G41 X-547.576 Z76. B0.0 D20"", it was wrong. The matrix I wrote has completely failed. It has returned to a state where the coordinates have not been transformed. 2024-09-16 09-42-38-674 14.5MB Ryder Hi Study,  Thank you very much for your guidance. I followed the direction you suggested to look for the issue and found a problem with the matrix in my custom PB_CMD_wwb_angle_rotate. I prevent coordinate transformations on planes other than ""ZX,"" so I have set conditions to limit this.  The question now is, if I don't impose plane restrictions, then other planes will also undergo coordinate transformations, which is not allowed. Now that I've identified the problem, how should I resolve it?  Awaiting your reply online, thank you very much for your enthusiasm and professionalism.  Study Does that mean PB_CMD_before_motion is not run before every move (when bad coordinates - not transformed through your matrix?) To debug MOM_output_literal a line every time in that routine and make it is run before each move. The before_motion event should be followed directly by motion events but it is possible some other routine is playing with mom_pos. The line that turns on/off cutter comp may not be a move event (another possibility) and maybe before_motion not called before.  MOM_output_literal ""<--------- before_motion (X$::mom_pos(0), Y$::mom_pos(1), Z$::mom_pos(2))"" Ryder Thank you very much for your guidance, Study. Through testing, I found that PB_CMD_before_motion is working properly. The issue lies within my own PB_CMD_wwb_angle_rotate. The problematic section of code is as follows. When I removed the ""ZX"" plane condition restriction, the G18 side program worked properly. However, problems occurred with G17.  Ryder Through testing, I found that when outputting in the XY plane, `mom_cutcom_plane=""XY""`, but when ""YZ"" or ""ZX"", it outputs ""NONE"". Therefore, I modified the code as follows, which seems to have resolved all the issues. Thank you very much for your help, Study!  ||| Ryder Thank you for your response, Study.

I followed the direction you suggested to look for the issue and found a problem with the matrix in my custom PB_CMD_wwb_angle_rotate. I prevent coordinate transformations on planes other than ""ZX,"" so I have set conditions to limit this.  The question now is, if I don't impose plane restrictions, then other planes will also undergo coordinate transformations, which is not allowed. Now that I've identified the problem, how should I resolve it?  Awaiting your reply online, thank you very much for your enthusiasm and professionalism.  Study Does that mean PB_CMD_before_motion is not run before every move (when bad coordinates - not transformed through your matrix?) To debug MOM_output_literal a line every time in that routine and make it is run before each move. The before_motion event should be followed directly by motion events but it is possible some other routine is playing with mom_pos. The line that turns on/off cutter comp may not be a move event (another possibility) and maybe before_motion not called before.  MOM_output_literal ""<--------- before_motion (X$::mom_pos(0), Y$::mom_pos(1), Z$::mom_pos(2))"" Ryder Thank you very much for your guidance, Study. Through testing, I found that PB_CMD_before_motion is working properly. The issue lies within my own PB_CMD_wwb_angle_rotate. The problematic section of code is as follows. When I removed the ""ZX"" plane condition restriction, the G18 side program worked properly. However, problems occurred with G17.  Ryder Through testing, I found that when outputting in the XY plane, `mom_cutcom_plane=""XY""`, but when ""YZ"" or ""ZX"", it outputs ""NONE"". Therefore, I modified the code as follows, which seems to have resolved all the issues. Thank you very much for your help, Study!  ||| Study Ok. That is not so much of a postprocessor thing - you are asking about the path the cam processor creates from the operation settings. The postprocessor gets move events where the cam processor has broken down cutter comp moves. It is possible to modify the positions before they are output to program code but in my experience it hasnt been necessary. If you want to change mom_pos positions you can do it in PB_CMD_before_motion (in a typical postbuilder postprocessor.) I am not sure what matrix math is necessary for that but you can do so as needed. You will have a mom_mcs_goto and can turn it into the mom_pos you want. ||| Ryder I see, but that's exactly what I've been doing. However, when the 'CutCom Location' is turned off, all my coordinate transformations are correct. When 'CutCom Location' is set to 'All Finish Passes', the coordinate data becomes incorrect.

All your others changes you already made will be kept.Please also review the NXstart.conf file that you have already in use, because the NXCUSTOM_USER_OVERRIDE_ARGS is now using the multicharacter arguments and needs to be updated from the default file.The startup scripts have been completely reworked so (almost) all actions can be done from only one (NXstart.bat) script (most credits go to Eric on that), instead of many different scripts for each individual option.Also all the configuration, that was normally scattered over several scripts has now been brought into one (NXstart.conf), and the usual, NX_env.dat file.This to reduce the need to edit the script, and keep all configuration in one file. With command line argument, it is also possible to control the different startup options.NX Administrators have control over the arguments that users are allowed to use.After this full release, the scripts (NXstartup folder) and the Custom Library (NXxxxxlibrary) will be released separately and will become more version independent.By default the script will start the highest installed NX version that has a matching NXxxxxlibrary in the NXcustom folder. But you can run any NX version by using the /v argument. Other applications, packages or groups can be assigned with different arguments.The legacy scripts will still work and are delivered in an archive folder.Eventually the support for those scripts will be canceled.More details on the above can be found in the About_NX2306custom.pdf and the NX2306_README.pdf.Important note:Some are having issues with the default location of the UGII_USER_PROFILE_DIR that indirectly is set by the NXCUSTOM_USER_SETTINGS_LOCATION.Please check the ""User Settings"" chapter in the README for more details.Please give us feedback, if you think this is the way to go.And as usual: If there are any ideas for improvements, please feel free to contact me or Eric directly by email (found in the readme).","gajdos When I start NXstart.bat  with NXstart.conf, I get:   Stefan Pendl What NX releases have you installed?

There are different ways how to import tools into MRL. PLMXML You can use plmxml_import. You can export one existing tool with PLMXML export. This gives you a good example how the PLMXML file should look like. Then you can create your own PLMXML file with one or multiple tools and import it. Check the Teamcenter TDoc for PLMXML. There are good hints. Vendor Import Another good approach to get tools easily into MRL is the vendor import. You can download actual tooling data from tool vendors in GTC or DIN format and import those packages into MRL. This is very powerful. You get all the tools with attribute values and real 3D graphics. Give it a try. You can download vendor packages for example from Sandvik orToolsUnit.com.  HTH  Markus

We can prevent a simple parametric tool from ramping too quickly, without the need for a solid tool model.  This should prevent any incompatible path from being created.   See the help page here: https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20231101866122454.mfgmilling/parent_tool_more_opt  Engagemotions Specifies the following parameters for additional control of the tool when it enters part material: Ramp Angle Sets the angle at which the tool cuts into the material. The ramp angle determines the starting location of the tool. TheRamp Anglevalue should be greater than 0 degrees but less than 90 degrees. The tool starts the ramping move at the point of intersection between the ramping angle and the specified vertical clearance. No ramping occurs if the area to be cut is smaller than the radius of the tool. Helical Diameter Sets a maximum ramp diameter for helical engage motions. Min Ramp Length Sets the minimum ramp length forRamp on Shapeengage type. You should set this value when you define a ramping or helical engage motion into material with a non-center cutting tool,such as an insert cutter. Use a large enough value to ensure that there is no uncut material under the center of the cutter.  (emphasis mine)  Hope that helps out!  balaji19991 @JasonOtto​ Thank you for your reply.

I kept my maintenance up to date.For the first year the maintenance renewal cost was reasonable. Then in Oct 2022 I received an email stating the maintenance price would increase by 15% for perpetual and only 10% if switched to subscription. I decided to renew maintenance of my perpetual license and not switch thinking the maintenance fee won't increase again anytime soon.Now my maintenance is about to expire in about 40 days and I thought of renewing it but received a quote 25% higher than last year. 15+25 which is 40% higher now. Didn't receive any email notification regarding this.Feels like Siemens is punishing me to renew maintenance.Is it common to increase the maintenance fee every year by a substantial margin?Subscription license for a year is cheaper than maintaining perpetual license?Shouldn't it be the other way around?

I paid a good amount of money the last couple of years for perpetual licenses, just to see the cost of maintenance increase by 15% every year in an obvious attempt to kill them off.  Subscription licensing may have it's place, but there are some very good reasons for me to not want to be forced into it.   In short, renting software I depend on to make a living doesn't seem like a good idea to me.  If anyone agrees, please comment so we can at least make our concerns known.   balaji19991 @HMTim​ Thank you for your detailed response. I feel your pain and agree with all your points, even I am unhappy about this push for subscription. Feels like we are at their mercy. The cost of maintenance is going up every year for perpetual and it's becoming financially stressful to maintain it. If we ever have a hardware failure our entire investment is down the drain if we don't have an active maintenance contract.

I guess for new customers just starting out subscription can be a good option with less initial investment or someone who just needs the software for a single project. I agree with you if Siemens decides to increase the price by a crazy amount we would be stuck with no way out but to pay them or having nothing to work with.  I have about 30days left for renewing my maintenance and I am not sure which route to take. I decided to go with Siemens thinking they wouldn't go the subscription route but highly disappointed with the way they are pushing everyone to subscription.

That being said, opening the same file and performing the same actions on the same toolpath in 2406 did not result in the toolpath reordering, so maybe this was fixed in future releases. I didn't think of checking the most recent version because its ruined in so many other places, but good idea and thank you. Stefan Pendl I use the latest NX release for testing any issues that I encounter in the release I use currently. I only switch to a new release after fully testing it, if I encounter problems in the new release, I report them to have them fixed. If I do not encounter any issues in the new release anymore, I switch to the new release. Burnzy Ya I didn't even think of being on an older release as I'm usually up to date but I couldn't stand a few things about 2406 so I've stayed put. Wish I could test versions but I've got too much going on to risk saving files on a new version that has bugs, I'm usually just up to date. I reported the issue to my VAR and they informed me that a new update came out today to fix some issues I had with 2406 so I'll give it another shot. Appreciate it! Stefan Pendl When I test, I do not use a production part directly, I use a copy of that part just for testing. ||| Burnzy This is in 2312.7000.

Please check and let me know what can I do to improve the analysis time.  Thanks. a_h_480_opt70_fem1_sim1-sol5 31KB ||| JimB(Siemens Employee) You are running an older version of the solver on old hardware so the option to improve performance are somewhat limited.  The Lanczos factorization is being done in memory, but with a sparse solver. The most significant issue is the 350 GB of IO - 280 GB of this is occurring during the eigenvalue solution. If you had a significant amount of additional memory (i.e. at least 256GB, better yet 512 GB), most or all of this scratch could be held in core memory (rather than being written/read from disk), but on a 16 GB ram machine (or even the 32 GB one), that is not an option. If the disk is a SATA drive, IO performance will suffer even more compared to a SSD drive.  If you can update to the 2406 release, the Lanczos factorization could be done using the MUMPS solver rather than sparse. You would probably see at least a 2x speedup using this MUMPS solver. More improvements will come with the 2412 release.  In short, to increase performance with the 2312 release, you really need faster disk IO (SSD disk or multiple SATA/SSD drives in a RAID 0 type array), or enough memory to eliminate most of the physical disk IO."

So I ditched the python method and went with XML but I'm running into the same problem.  I've tried NewCoordinate and many other things but it always calls the G53.1 first. and also, I cant even check the G100 line for G53.1 as an MCParam because it throws a parser error! If I try to define G53.1 as an MCParam of G100, then use ""if isDefined(G53.1)"" the simulation throws an ""error in parsing G53."" because the decimal is causing a problem.

In the short term, you can turn the on-plane stepover for area milling back on in the customer defaults.  This is a legacy option, but you can still use it  on an 'as-is' basis if will help you through your programming until you find a good replacement operation.  I hope that helps out.

Although the new stepover interface get simplified but we did notice the gap between the Area Mill applied stepover On Plane and On Part with zig zag pattern. We are working on the fix and will improve the function. For the case you provide where the cut area is near planar face, the bunching of zig zag should be avoided and need to fix. For the smoothing, we need to improve so that the similar smoothing toolpath should be there as on plane."

This is the most used setup during the machining, but in some case, machining must be at the other side of part, so must be rotated around Z axis (6th axis rotate).I want to set initial rotation about Z axis (I try by ude, from where rotation matrix will be created and the part will be move to the front to spindle, where be in machining range), but no results achieved.How set this initial rotation, which affect to the rest of machining? I assume, that mom_tool_axis must be changed by this initial rotation.Summarizing, I want to create procedure to control 6th axis of machine that change the rest of postprocessing patch.","Study This is a case I have dealt with a few times. In my trials - there was not a good way (that I found at the time) to tell NX that it needed to transform (from 6th axis change) all point vectors then determine a kinematic solution with the result. I did the math for it all but don't recommend that. Now (since NX9) with MOM_convert_point I think a couple of calls could do it (take mom_pos/mom_tool_axis send once with modified tool vector for 6th then send result for 4/5th.) I haven't tried it yet. This may be something Post Configurator handles. Ideal would be to use Rotate UDE to turn one of the 3 and have the other two solved by the result. ||| Juraj(Partner) Jack, maybe I am wrong, but from what you are saying, AC head B table, your 6th axis is B table (010). Anyway I have never deal with 6th axis, only 5 and 6th was like dead. Posibble solution what I saw once -- could be to use 2 mcs - main and local and from its relative position read angle and make it like 6th axis. So operation is generated AC to the local mcs like normal 5axis, and B is outputed like rotation local to main mcs (math from csys matrix).

As you mentioned, you can use conditions to find ""applicable"" tools. However, you cannot use conditions to define a relative preference or priority.  By default FBM will select the most stable tool (simplified that is the tool with the largest diameter & shortest length).  We just recently developed an enhancement to the automatic tool selection that will allow users to specify their own priority rules (using TCL). This will allow you to prefer tools from e.g. your prefered tool supplier over those from alternative tool suppliers. To do that, you would obviously need to add the name of your tool supplier to the tool database (and you would have to write a bit of TCL code).  This brand new capability will be introduced in the upcoming NX12.0.2 version and is unfortunately NOT available for earlier versions of NX.  Tom van 't Erve NX CAM Development ||| Salvador     ||| Stefan Pendl  I think that this change also includes additional source code for some DLLs, so the entire testing suite must be run against it.   The migration from NX 11.0.2 to NX 12.0.x should be much painless.   As mentioned above the Tcl code might only be the top of the iceberg. ||| Tom1607550694420 Hi,  For those interested in this enhancement, the core functionality is available in NX11.0.2 MP7. Please contact me by private message in which you indicate your tool database type (ASCII, MRL, TDM, ...) and we'll let you know where and and how to add the few lines of TCL code.  Please note that you will need to make a few small changes to the TCL (< than 5 minutes of work) once you move to NX12.0.2 or or later.  Tom van 't Erve NX CAM Development ||| Salvador     ||| Muddi_91 Hi Salvador,  thank you for your advise.  Do you define your flag in the tool type of the tool_database? For me, it would be also interesting how to implement and use the TCL code for the tools. ||| Salvador Hi Muddi,  In my case, it was simpler to add two columns to my tool_database.dat aiming to use these flags in the MKE for the tool selection.      What I have tested in TCL is a custom program for the tool selection, this function opens, closes and filters the tool_database every time it is called, causing the poor performance I mentioned in my previous comment. Probably there is a better way to do it.   ||| Reinier Capelle For the documentation of this function, please search for “Assigning Tool Priorities” in the NX Documentation.

I made changes in configurator - In output settings -sub program support on . If i do this i'm getting individual files without initial lines/ the description line .  Can you please help me with the proc or any lines i have to add in TCL file (Postconfigurator) , so that i can get the desired output. ||| Nagaraj Patil Hi sfot, Let me give some more detail about my requirement , I have developed the postprocessor by using Post configurator .

S is a string used for number formatting in TCL (the specs are available online). This is new functionality which can be used to format a number in any way supported by TCL. F is the % character (just by itself with no quotes). This is new functionality to indicate the value should be hidden if the value is zero.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O000061xWVBSA2/tool-library-harveyhelicalmicro100-tools,Tool Library Harvey/Helical/Micro100 tools,"As much as I loathe Mastercam, it appears they have teamed up with these tool manufacturers to have imported tool libraries of their entire catalogs.https://www.harveyperformance.com/tool-libraries/This would save me endless hours and increase my productivity. Maybe Siemens will join them one day.I remember hearing about the MRL library. Does anyone out there use it? What manufacturers is it limited to? If it was initially developed by Siemens, it may be hard to get all the tool manufacturers on-board.I would even select a particular brand just because it was already available in a library. There is a difference between cutting tool brands, but generally they are very close. It usually boils down to which one is in stock and can be delivered the fastest.Edit: Looks like Gibbs, and SolidCAM, and Esprit are also now on-board with Harvey. Would be nice if someone from Siemens reached out to collaborate with them to get the ball rolling. Or maybe Harvey should reach out to Siemens? Just having these tools in an NX file, and not even in the .dat database files would save me countless hours. Other tool manufactures would probably follow suit if their customers asked, after becoming used to picking from a predefined library.I am still curious what % of shops use the MRL. It seems like a very long and tedious data entry process, and expense.","Dstryr The harvey tool stuff would be great. Im working on doing one with destiny tool that I'd share if anyone else uses them? They are within walking distance to me and we primarily use their tools besides titanium work.  ||| Ken_A If I understand correctly, the MRL can import data that follows - ISO13399 - needs additional ""GTC"" (Generic tool catalog?) data as well (I think).  That way tool vendors don't need to do CAM systems one-by-one. I'm not sure what other CAM vendors support those standards for importing tool data.  I have heard you can get the ""entire"" Sandvik catalog (x0,000 tools), although it may take a while to load (days?). You can download individual Sandvik & Kennametal tools.  I'm sure others as well.  ||| Markus Dietz In MRL you can create your tool components and assemblies manually on your own. Or you can import Generic Tool Catalogs (GTC) with real vendor data (incl. 3D). Different tool vendor already provide GTC packages.  For example: Sandvik Coromant https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/en-gb/downloads/tool-data/Pages/download-tool-data.aspx (You need to register there for free.)  ToolsUnited https://www.toolsunited.com/App?language=en They have ca. 900.000 tool components from different vendors. You can search there for free. If you want to download GTC, you need an account. For testing you can request at TU a test account to test the GTC download.  The GTC import performance has improved. Now importing one product takes approximately 1 or 1.5 seconds. You don't need to import all products in one go. In the classification tree you can select the desired class and import only the products from this class (and subclasses). This allows you to get the relevant components quickly.  Hope this helps...  Markus  ||| JarrodMiller To explicitly answer the MRL question and clearly state what might be obvious to some but not others:     As PART of that functionality, MRL includes the capability of importing GTC library data (ISO 13399 specifies the format for these libraries.) Siemens and other tool vendors including Sandvik, ISCAR and worked jointly to develop this ISO specification. Vendors are in various states of implementing it (for example, Kennametal and ISCAR publish tool data in GTC format, but don't currently make a full catalog downloadable in a single large package)        ||| Dstryr I'd like to know how many people are actually using the MRL.... I'd wager that its like 100 to 1 of people using text libraries vs MRL? ||| Glenn Balon (TNC) @DstryrNot many. I have been to dozens of shops and know many other people who have been to even more shops than myself. I've been asking around ever since I heard of it. Half do not know what it is, and the other half do not use it.  I'd like to attempt to, but it takes time I do not have.

Provide only tcl and def file to customer. Do not share pui file. Create SoldTo/Install output in post processed file. ||| Calvin(Partner)     ||| Study ||| Schimanski  Hi Study,  yes yes the postprocessor world is crazy already. When I develop a postprocessor specifically for a customer, I not only process the know-how of the customer in the NC code, but also implement corresponding solutions and NX interfaces with my programming know-how. Both should be protected! The PB I know too little, since I am currently only concerned with the PC. Of course, there is always the requirement of customers to disclose the source code. But in what form or documentation, there is scope. Therefore in the PC the different functions to encrypt, time bomb or Sold To ID. If the customer wants to have everything open, well then he can, but the post office remains protected by Sold To ID and Time Bomb. For the protection of my source code, the customer must commit to me. There are then nice dicussions with the customer IT ;-). My opinion is that as a postprocessor developer I do not deliver an unencrypted postprocessor. After all, yes, I also get proper trouble if it has postprocessor errors or does not work as ordered. If the customer does not accept that, okay. Gives enough to other customers. Incidentally, I can not get the source code of Windows as a customer either. Maybe there will eventually be free post processors for NX. But they are just as good as the competitors in the market ;-)  NX 12.0.1 Windows 10 Enterprise ||| Mak_Jo At start of program, create a block with below statement  MOM_output_literal ""SoldTo_Install ID xxxx"". Mention actual id of customer instead of xxxx. So each time user post process the tool path in NX, first line would be their SoldTo ID  Check the syntax of the above as I don't remember. ||| Schimanski Hi,  if you use the Post Configurator, then you can encrypt your postprocessors, add a time bomb and limit them to Sold To ID`s.  There are three licenses for the Post Configurator:  Basic:                           - Free and included in all NX CAM licenses Advanced: NX31439 - Get all owners of a Post Builder license for free! Full:            NX31440 - must be bought and only then can be used also the encryption, time bomb and Sold To ID functions.  Please also note the new Post Hub platform. This is a cloud in which one can offer and test postprocessors. In the future maybe whole machine kits, with simulation. Is currently in the testing phase and a great idea to make postprocessors available worldwide and makes it easier for the end user to find postprocessors and their providers!   ||| Majid Hello, I did this before for a company. You can embed .tcl and .def files in a dll file and force NX to run the files from there using NXOpen. I remember I wrote a VB code for this. You can then read McAddress, computers hardware serial numbers (hard disks, motherboard, graphic card, modem...) or extract server information (License Server, Sold To ID, Webkey, Issuer, Version, Siemens Licensing version) and use them to lock the dll file to be run only for a designated PC or customer. I also wrote a code to read the date from internet in order to make expiration date for the post processor. Also a connection to a ftp containing counter text files, when the number of post outputs should be limited, so the dll file read the current number over the internet and added one into the defined file until the limited number of post processings reached.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D5Vb00000C79KuKAJ/threadmill-depths,Threadmill Depths,"What do I need to do to get NX to cut single point threadmills to the specified depth thats in the toolpath? Threadmills are never right the first time we cut them and always need adjustment. I have a tool with a .050 ""flute length"" that is set to cut at -.300 in the toolpath. The result was a thread that was .225 deep. The tracking point is at the bottom of the tool and not adjustable and I understand that the cutting edge is halfway from the bottom of the tool to the top of the flute length. That and the threads arealwaysundersize, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I want them right the first time. What needs to be done to achieve this?Even my drilling operation before this doesn't go to the depth specified in the toolpath. I have the drill operation set to go .360 deep and its going to .336. Changing the tracking point from tip to shoulder changes nothing in the code as well.","Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) Handling this nicely would involve implementing an enhancement request. Currently, manual overrides are the way to accomplish what you are after, unfortunately. The depth can be adjusted a few ways and they are all simple so I won't address that here. The pitch diameter does however merit explaining if you want perfect threads the first time.  What I have done as a solution for myself, is created a formula to override the major diameter of the threads I am cutting. The reason for this is, the major diameter of the thread is what drives the toolpath. Ideally, the pitch diameter should be driving the toolpath, so I created a formula to effectively do just that as a workaround.   =((SQRT(3)/2)*B3)+((B2-2*(0.375*((SQRT(3)/2)*B3)))+(B5*B3))  Above is the formula I am referring to. Feel free to use this yourself. This works for all internal threads with a 60 degree thread angle, including metric, english, NPT, etc. To use the formula, you input the basic major diameter and pitch of the thread you are cutting. In the example above, this is for an M10x1.5 thread. The pitch value must be the distance between threads, so for a 1/4-20 thread, your basic major would be 0.25 and your pitch would be 0.05. The class factor is something I never change as the 0.05 value works well for all of the threads I have cut. This is a generally good value for targeting the middle of the pitch diameter tolerance for most 3B/6H thread sizes. The value calculated in the ""new major"" field is the value you want to use to override the major diameter of your thread in NX, as seen in the screenshot below (I rounded the 10.3997... to 10.4).   When generated, this will result in a toolpath which will cut a perfectly sized thread (near the middle of the pitch diameter min/max tolerance), assuming a perfectly rigid setup. It is of course still up to you to do what you need to compensate for tool deflection if you need to."

Most companies don't purchase it due to the price. ||| mkn Off topic: I don't agree with Eric's comments, I worked in a company where Contour profil was an extra license, and I didn't have access to it, and I was very happy to find this operation, obviously not everything is automatic and I find it good, it's in my top list of operations on Nx (I'm not kidding!).How nice it is to generate an operation quickly. Toansweryour question, the only help you'll find is in theNX doc(I don't think there are any tutorials on the web). If you're new to Nx, I think Contour profile is right for you (you don't have total control, but it's easier). After that, I think it's a mistake to use Generic Motion operation. This operation is capable of generating continuous 5-axis movements based on ruled surfaces ?? 😐 Are you sure 😏 ??? . If you have a demo, I'd love to see it. Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) @mkn​, I am sure you understand programming is an art. I came to have my opinions based on my experience, just as you have yours. I have no intention to debate with you, but I will add that I think if you had Contour Profile available to you, there is a good chance you would have preferred it over Sequential Mill. And when it comes to using Generic Motion, I have found myself in situations where the continuous five axis motion I was after could not be represented as a simple ruled surface with no self-intersections. It was a rare case, but it occurred. Generic Motion handled it easily.  @D-MAN-NX​, I'll further add that the best thing you can do to improve, is to learn all the operations sufficiently enough to understand their strengths and weaknesses, then come to your own conclusions about what works for you in the way you think about the way you need to cut the features of the parts you are tasked with programming. Reading opinions of us on the internet can be somewhat helpful, but nothing beats spending time working through your problems in NX. Hopefully you have Contour Profile available to you and are able to compare it to Sequential Mill yourself. As for material to help learn Sequential Mill, it is sparse as the operation is a legacy one which does not seem to get updates. I would not be surprised if I saw the operation removed in the future. D-MAN-NX I used to stay away from sequential till I came to Northrop and I saw the strength of it. Took me a while to understand it but you got to admit it's pretty cool knowing that it's APT base.

I can only get it to work correctly by storing the current values into R variables, writing the CROT angles, and then re-writing the others back from the R variables.

Really keen for a OMP layer for Fanuc and Siemens based controllers using Renishaw Inspection+.  Many thanks, Adam Uwe Roosz Hello Adam,  in the NX2406 there will be support for some controllers with the cycle version >= V1.1 (see PostHub), which will then support Renishaw I+. In cycle version V1.2, this will be Sinumerik, Fanuc, Haas, Okuma and Mitsubishi, currently in version V1.1 this is only Sinumerik for I+.

Uwe Roosz Hi Kal,  Thanks for your assessment. I may not share this, but I am very interested in what these points are in a one-on-one exchange. In the past, we have invested a lot of time in initial development, and we are constantly expanding existing and new features, as well as working on fixing and maintaining inconsistencies. Through the PostHub, we regularly share new features, enhancements and bug fixes with all customers and interested parties, even between major releases. Please take a look at the current NX versions from time to time to see if your issues and requests have already been resolved. And if you have opened an call, we will even inform you automatically when and in which version it has been fixed. We are happy to take into account the feedback we receive in order to continuously improve the product. Therefore, I would like to invite you to submit points as IR/ER via GTAC. These will then be evaluated by us and taken into account in the development. Fanuc support will now follow in NX2406 with the implementation of Renishaw I+ cycles soon. I am sorry that we have not been able to meet your expectations to optimally support all features and different controllers from minute 1, but we are working hard to optimize this with the available resources over time. I appreciate your understanding and feedback is always welcome.  Thanks, Uwe shags72 I created my own probing routines using gen mot and ude's. This was for GnL machines.

When I select a tool in the Machine Tool View, it is displayed at the MCS. If no MCS available is shows at the WCS. I have used this for years to define and create tools. Now, when I pick a tool with a toolpath, it always shows the tool at the beginning of the toolpath of the 1st operation under the tool. I can have 100s of operations under one tool. The 1st move of the 1st operation listed under the tool is not the position I need the tool displayed at. In what situation would I want the tool displayed at the 1st move of an operation when selecting a tool. If I wanted to see the 1st move of path I would select the path, not the tool.

The new tool display locations also ensure that the tool is displayed in defined locations following a clear ruleset.

Otherwise, I have to reposition each time. If the tool has a path, then it shows at 1st point in the 1st path, which not needed unless I am verifying. The 1st path listed under the tool would most likely be from 1st operation, so if you have multiple OPs in one file, the displayed tool will still most likely be hidden in the part.

If I enter the correct stepover and depth of cut from an adaptive toolpath into the optimize feedrate option with a .004 length interval, how come it changes the feedrate so much? I thought adaptive milling kept a constant chip thickness, so how is optimize feedrate doing so much work to a toolpath thats already supposed to be keeping a constant chip thickness?The difference in the adaptive toolpath without optimization compared to the toolpath with optimization is a 67% reduction in cycle time. Seems excessive for a path thats supposed to be optimized from the start.","Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) If you are using bottom up cutting, the feedrate on the smaller axial depth cuts will increase in proportion to the decrease in axial depth from nominal. This would explain the 67% reduction in cycle time. You will really want to check whether or not your tool and machine can handle the optimized feedrates in this case.  As for why it is taking so much time to optimize, that is likely due to your .004in length interval. You are asking NX to reconsider the feedrate every .004in along the toolpath. This value seems excessively small. You may want to consider increasing this value.  If you haven't already, please read the documentation on optimize feedrate:https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20230425446868577.mfggeneral/id1342400  Burnzy So does this Feed Rate Optimization not function as intended in a situation where bottom up cutting / or even a variable stock removal whether axially or radially occur? I'm not so much worried about the time it takes to generate, I expected it to take longer with such a small interval. I had a demo of Vericut recently and am exploring this feature within NX to get comparable results. Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) It's hard to say whether or not it is working correctly without seeing your setup, toolpath, and the resulting feedrates. If you are able to file an IR sharing a .prt file showing what you are seeing, that would be helpful.  Variable stock removal is expected when using the optimization, and it is the reason we want to optimize - to compensate for those variations using changes in feedrate. Burnzy I can't share the real part but heres a similar situation. This whole experiment stems from having a program optimized by Vericut and my exploring options with NX that could compare to how Vericut handled its optimizations. You'll see that my feedrate minimum is at 1ipm and max is at 500ipm. 500 ipm because that was the max that Vericut spit out.

Is this essentially NX's version of what Vericut does?,"gsen Maybe the photo that atteched will be helpful for you  Ap=Cut Depth Ae=Cut Widht   ||| Joe Taylor(Siemens Employee) Hi Burnzy,  Feedrate Optimization is aimed at optimizing the feedrates to improve cycle times and enhance tool life.  The feedrate optimization is measuring the amount of IPW the tool is intersecting at regular intervals (specified by you as the users).  At these intervals, if the cross-sectional area of the IPW is less than the nominal width and depth then we will increase the feedrate at this point (up to the maximum specified). If the cross-sectional area is more, we will reduce the feedrate  (down to the minimum specified).  These changes are up to the limits you are setting in the dialog here; The issue with the scallop as a stepover is a potentially varying intersection angle of the tool. For now we can only give a static Cut Width and Cut Depth. You could set these to a approximate value based on the scallop stepover, and then when the tool hits less IPW it will increase the feedrate and when it hits more IPW it will slow down.  I hope this helps, Joe Taylor, Product Owner"

I need advice on how to calculate the orientation of the blade of the oscillating knife in the post-processor. I have a CURVE DRIVE operation in five axes and an oscillating knife is running along the track which is still perpendicular to the control surface. The blade must always be positioned in the direction of the path. It is a machine with a Sinumerik control system and uses (SPOS=) for orientation.Would anyone advise how to achieve this?Thank you","Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) You will need to calculate the correct orientation at every motion event. If you are using Post Configurator, you can make use of an advanced turbo callback to call your orientation calculating code. ||| PaLi(Partner) in the attachment I am sending a PDF with a description of what I am trying to do. In the description you can see what the machined part looks like and also the path curve. On a classic 5-axis milling center with X Y Z B C (HEAD/TABLE) kinematics and a Sinumerik 840D control system, they use a special non-rotating tool to engrave grooves in a plastic part. This tool is guided on the surface of the part along the created curve (Spiral) and it is necessary that the blade of the tool is always oriented in the direction of the cut. It uses the SPOS= function for this orientation. I currently do this by creating an operation and generating and manually padding the SPOS= with the desired angle so that it is +/- in the cut direction. I have to do it like this on every line and it's really tedious. The parts on which there is this spiral are always the same in shape, and the shape of the spiral is the same and only the size changes. The part is clamped on the table at an angle so that the table cannot suddenly turn in another direction during positioning. At another CAMU, they calculated the orientation of the blade during post-processing and it worked for them. I am also trying to do this, but without success. I create the postprocessor in PostConfigurator, and if a layer could be created that would be able to calculate the orientation for me, that would be great.  I still have no idea how to proceed. Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) We do have the capability to control the tool orientation (sixth axis) at the toolpath level in NX. The way it is done is via the Robot Control functionality. This, as its name implies, is intended to be used when programming >=6 axis robots, though you could certainly make use of it in this context.  Edit: now that I think of it a bit more, the Robot Control is probably not a good solution here due to the difference in machine kinematics.  For your specific case, my preference would be to write the necessary code in the post processor to do this. You could simply activate the functionality via a single UDE at the start of path.  If you are still uncertain about what to do next to solve this problem, you may want to consider attending an instructor-led Post Configurator course, where you will learn how to develop post processors using the Post Configurator user interface and Tcl code. Feel free to emailtraining.usa.plm@siemens.comif you are interested in the course. JörgP(Partner) Hello Eric,  please, can you be more specific with the name of the 6th-axis variable. The robot control is not useable without a robot model. Are there other variables to use? A tool path vector calculation within the postprocessor would be very effortful and slow down the postprocess. More over, we need the next position (something like ""mom_nxt_pos(..)""), which is not available as standard output. I ask because I see the same requirements comming in additive manufacturing with 2 or more inline nozzles at one head.  Greets, Jörg Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) As of right now, I do not think we have what I would consider an ideal solution for this. The best I can think to do at the moment is to handle this in the post. Maybe with an ER and enough support behind it, we can add orientation vector data to UF_PATH_*_motion, but I would not anticipate seeing something like that anytime soon, especially since we did not see this as part of the solution for robotic machining.  Aside from doing this purely in the post, another option is to implement a solution similar to how robotic machining works. Essentially, you could have an NX Open program or journal edit your toolpath to calculate the vectors at every motion event and add UDEs containing the vector data before each motion event. Then the post could use this data.  Again, I see no ideal solution currently. Both of these options have pros and cons which need to be weighed and decided on.  I apologize if I misled you about a sixth-axis variable. I was referring to the robot_location_data event, which is probably not something you want to use here. PaLi(Partner) Hello Eric,  I don't think it is achievable that this function will ever be added to NX CAM. Currently, the only solution I see is to calculate the orientation of the tool when generating the nc program in the postprocessor. I know that some have set this in the post processor, but they were not willing to share the procedure. I have met other users with competing cam programs in which there is no such function, but they have it solved in the post-processor, where the tool positioning is calculated. I tried to refine some result in the post processor, but so far without success. Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) @PaLi(Partner)​ I don't have a solution to provide you, but assuming you are creating toolpaths with adequate point density and equal spacing between points, you should be able obtain a sufficient orientation vector for the current point by calculating the bisector of the vectors which are described by the previous point to the current point, and the current point to the next point, then doing a couple of cross products to ensure the vector you are calculating is perpendicular to the tool axis.

The closest I get is by using a Generic Feature Operation to define path for a pure parametrical context ... (not 5axis and not free shaped).

With number of segments n (here 360 for 360 times 1 degree) defined within the loop the circular move/spindle orient look like : and  This results into the following output CLS:  NC (The PP is a current one, never tailored/validated for this use case) Thanks,  Toon  ToonVDK A simple file as attached to demonstrate a simple path as mentioned in previous comment KnifeCutting 317KB ||| ToonVDK A simple file as attached to demonstrate a simple path as mentioned in previous comment KnifeCutting 317KB ||| JörgP(Partner) Hi PaLi,  I wanna share a tip for another option in Sinumerik: Please check out the functions related to ""Orientations relative to the path"" (ORIPATH, ORIROTC, ...).

Do I have to make copies of these tools for every different pitch I need milled?","tobias_klein You need to define the form type as partial profile. Pitch is the representing the maximum pitch which can be machined with this tool.  ||| Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) You can certainly do this, but there is a bug to be aware of which you need to work around.  On your tool, be sure to use the Partial Profile 60 for thread mills with a 60 degree thread angle. I typically set the pitch on the tool to the max pitch the tool can do, then set the flute length value equal to that.  When using this tool in a thread milling operation, there is a bug when using the From Model value in the Form and Pitch parameter. The operation seems to recognize the correct thread size, but the resulting toolpath has a pitch equal to the pitch value set on the tool, not the recognized thread pitch. You can work around this by using the From Table value in the Form and Pitch parameter, then selecting the thread profile and size you want to cut. This will result in a toolpath with the correct pitch. You can make multiple operations this way, each with different thread sizes, all using the same tool. Burnzy Thank you. When I change this to partial profile 60, Collision check for cutting prevents the toolpath from being made- is this normal? Burnzy I see what happening for the collision check to be triggered. I'm trying to cut a 1/4-20 and a 1/4-28 thread within the same toolpath. Is that not allowed?  When I select 1/4-20 on one hole, as soon as i click on the next hole it switches the thread to the minimum thread size under the UNC dropdown and this is just a loop.

This works.As a nice side effect the icon gets changed, too. The image that it uses seems to come from an operation of the drilling.prt .Knowing, drilling is on critical maintenance, Where does the icon image come from? I'd like to become independent of it. I couldn't find it in the NX installation directory.Best whishes,Joachim","Mark the retired guy The icon is a name match to the template object.  For example, if you create an operation my_drilling in a template, the system will search for an icon named ""my_drilling"". The search path is like other UI icons - first it searches the internal library, then the user icons in UGII_BITMAP_PATH.  If you do not want to use the name match, you cna define an additional attribute CAM_ICON. ||| Joachim1658846628329         ||| Ken_A Most likely because in the ""Drill"" template part there is an operation ""Boring"", so it is getting the icon from the place NX stores their icons for CAM objects (which users may not have access to)  Choose a different name for the operation? ||| Mark the retired guy There are thousands of icons in the internal library of the system. These are not seen as files in the installation - they are built in to the code.  In this case, there is an internal bitmap named ""boring"", so that is used.    ||| Joachim1658846628329      ||| Mark the retired guy    We don't have any plans to remove the internal icons, even if a fuction goes on critical maintenance or is retired. So ""our"" icons should always be in the system. If you want specific ""create"" dialog icons, or want to use them as a starting point to customize your own, let me know and we can provide them.  The template_parts/images folder is used for OOTB tooltip images.  Preview images are in the same folders as the parts (template_parts/metric, /english) because they have different colors for english and metric.   ||| Joachim1693462646533 Additional to this I have another problem. I have copied the template-file hole_making.prt and saved it with my own name. Then I have copied the operation DRILLING and saved it under DRILLING_OWN. If I don't create a DRILLING_OWN.bmp in my Bitmap-Folder I get another drilling-Icon if I call the template, but not the same from the original-DRILLING-Operation. If I create an icon with the name DRILLING_OWN.bmp I get a message that the opening of the bitmap-file failed. What's wrong? What's the right size for this BMPs? Is there something new what we should know? In past I did this very often and it allways worked. I use NX10.0.1.4 MP1 Actually, I have more important things to do than to worry about such trivialities. ||| Stefan Pendl There is no need to rename the template in my opinion.  SeeCreating custom operations in the default template prt filesfor a way to specify the OOTB icon.  So you would just add the attributeCAM_ICONwith the valuedrillingto the operation to get the OOTB icon for the operation. ||| Joachim1693462646533 I'm sorry. I've tried a lot now. My findings:  We work under Teamcenter. Perhaps this is the reason for this all. Please try it yourself. ||| Joachim1693462646533 Another Topic: What color should I choose in my bitmaps to get a transparency if I choose the Operation in template? Earlier it was RGB 192,192,192.

Siemens should release sequential mill 2.0 with a revamped UI of sequential mill and make the user interface a little friendlier for newer users. Update it to the newer NXopen base with some journal support. And add circl segment tool support. Sequential mill is a superior tool path to contour profile for your advanced user base. The only time I use contour profile is to follow the bottom of a wall when I want my tool to be tangent to my wall while driving 5 axis around the exterior or interior of a part. Even then it's very clunky with the customer received models from major aerospace companies. I give it about 5-10min before I start creating geometry to get variable contour or sequential mill to do what I want.  You can also drive a 5 axis surface with a 4 axis cut in sequential mill which is a huge time savings If you have a 4-axis horizontal mill and have 1 or 2 surfaces that need to be driven.

Sequential mill allows you full control over your tool path. It would be nice if siemens released an updated UI that was more user friendly to the new users starting out.

The XY translation of FIXEDCOMP appears to be correct, but the tool is moving in Z.  This would not be correct for a planar operation in G68.2.  I'm wondering if I need to customize GMe_SwivelingCalculateLinears to modify TABLEROTATE.  Can anyone give me a general idea of the areas of CSE that need to be modified?","Study With a Fanuc control - I believe only the translation specified (in WSEC table) affects anything unless TCP active (with WSEC.) Also - the control parameter needs to be set to table coordinates for tcp (not machine.) Is your case using WSEC with tcp (G43.4/G43.5?) If not - WSEC should have nothing in the rotations about X, Y and Z (they should be ignored like machine but cse probably tries to use them and sets rotations in FIXEDCOMP transformation.) ||| andrew.schaefers(Partner) Thank you for the reply.  You are correct, the implementation works out of the box for TCP-G43.4 operations, using FIXEDCOMP.  I've seen others have success with G54.4 and G68.2 on a Fanuc 31i control, and the documentation indicates that G68.2 can be called while in G54.4 mode.  I did not see any exceptions in the manual about the rotations.  I think I need to understand how G68.2 creates its transformation in CSE so I can modify it. ||| Study2 My understanding with only limited testing at machine is:  With tcp - G68.2 and G43.5 and 0,0,1 vector will align to a plane. Without tcp G53.1 is used to align to plane. It has been much more common in my experience to see G68.2 without tcp be used. G54.4 is a lot more useful (on top of) tcp since it provides an additional full transformation to adjust for part alignment errors on a 5 axis situation. G54.4 without tcp can only provide a slightly more dynamic (than G54.2) tracking for translation of an origin - no rotations will be honored.  With/without tcp G54.4 and G68.2 can be used together. G54.4 and G68.2 can not do the same thing (I think) without tcp. I have not tested but if G54.4 is set to align the frame to a different orientation without tcp it would be ignored at the machine (rotation, but translation would be used.) G68.2/G53.1 would align frame without tcp.  Anyway - from cse standpoint the G68.2 otb old implementation was to use ""ROTATIONAL"" for G68.2 and ""TABLEROTATE"" for effect of a table rotating on linear position/direction for G53.1. These are hidden otb I think but I have seen a custom implementation (I assume the same.) The chain can be interrogated by cse to determine TT vs HT but there is also a global variable that indicates it (GV_..)  You can look at transformation contents (rotational) with cse functions getDegree(getVector..(getMatrixRotation(getTrafoMatrix(""ROTATIONAL"")))) so you can verify if G68.2 is causing Z alignment problem (along with FIXEDCOMP and TABLEROTATE.)"

Create Feature Process groups the features having the same process ( = operations and tools). The outcome depends on the machining knowledge rules. One extreme: If you treat all features the same, they will end up in a single group (per feature type). Other extreme: If each feature instance is machined using a unique operation and tool, then you get many groups containing a single feature.  Features having identical attributes will have the same machining process and will appear in a single group. Except when there are milling operations  that cannot handle a change in tool axis and the features have different orientations. Then you will see groups per orientation. "

It was an all in one file with settings and everything needed. Comment would be that it was a challenge. It was a 4 axis edm head and one or two table rotaries. The application on the machine was gear part families so a lot of motion copy situations. I recall that I would key on a copy in NX to inhibit output and look at the copy frame and put out a rotary move and then call the same G code. The post I made was not all purpose - it was designed for handling a specific shape. GF used Esprit which was much more developed for the machine (according to them) but the company wanted to work more integrated (TC, models staying in managed.)   mpayen(Partner) Yes, thanks Study! the same happens to me, the client has a soft integrated into the machine that works very well but only can perform 2d profiles.

It would take a good deal of work to tell you all about that. Two highlight areas come to mind, though. First, when customizing the CAM environment it is very helpful to see how environment variables are set. An example would be the path to a shared network folder using UGII_CAM_RESOURCE_DIR. Secondly, When errors are reported NX will often give many more details about the error. Sometime the error can be corrected using this info. Usually this is added to the end of the log if viewed right after the error is displayed."

The actual machine manufacturer is telling me that no one uses a separate TC_CARR definition, as the head measurements and vectors all come from the tool variables.So my question is, what variables have to be passed to get the CSE to behave as the actual machine, using only one kinematic chain as defined in the TC_CARR.DEF file?The only variables that change in the cse to_ini file when using an angle head are $TC_DPV1, $TC_DPV2, and $TC_DPV3.Is it better to have separate tool carriers created or leave a single one?

CYCLE800 does make the postprocessors job easier, however, and I think that's why we see it in the OOTB examples. I'm currently trying to adjust mom_head_spindle_axis to get the rotary axis angles to be recalculated correctly in Sinumerik PC libs 5.5.8 without luck. In FANUC PC libs, this is working for us. On the real machine, you can build this tool as type 130 (angle head) with both tool length 1,2,3 and base tool lengths 1,2,3 ($TC_DP21, $TC_DP22, $TC_DP23) that will be added together for total tool length. With TRAORI (+ AROT) this should all work correctly together (and in G17), provided the post can output the correct recalculated rotary axis angles for the direction the head is pointing. Cutcom probably won't work in this case, though. Nor will vector programming (A3,B3,C3). For those, you probably need to build it as a tool carrier."

Andreas Johansson I went with Thomas_S suggestion and created a dummy fifth axis in the kinematic tree and after that the simulation start working.

I'm absolutely not a Fanuc expert, but G68.2 has always been intended as a 5 axis solution, where G54.2 (Rotary Table Dynamic Work Offset) has been the Fanuc solution for VMCs with a 4th axis and Horizontal machining centers as well. As such, I suspect you will find most NX post solutions for G68.2 have underlying code that is expecting to have a 5th axis to work with.  Have you confirmed it works on the actual machine? Confirmed with your local distributor that the control options are appropriate for the hardware (it is entirely possible to enable G68.2 on a Fanuc machine that cannot actually run it).

You mention the option G54.2 I have not worked with that function myself but when I look in the manual and read about it if a understand the manual correctly you only have 8 of them. I know that they run a lot of parts at the same time in the machines. I have seen programs with over 120 different offsets in them so maybe that´s why they order the machines with G68.2.

Also the planned retirement only affect the application, which will be further available as a legacy download in the support center for maintenance purposes. Means Post Builder will not be included in the initial installation with NX at a version in the future (exact version not decided yet).  We are aware that we can not just drop it due the amount of existing postprocessors build on Post Builder. This will be a longer transition phase.  Hope this make it clear and avoid any confusion. As you mentioned Post Config can not do all the jobs, I am keen to know which areas you think Post Config has still gaps?  Best regards, Thomas  NX CAM Product Management Marcel0 And what this means? 😕  ""...,but we strongly recommend that you switch to the Post Configurator platform.""  ThomasJ In short it means, we strongly recommend for any new post processors, for example when buying a new machine or controller retrofit, to use the Post Configurator platform. If purchasing the post processor by a partner/ reseller it means as a customer to get a post processor on the new framework.  We offered and executed multiple enablement sessions across the world for our partners/ customers over the last years, to allow a smooth transition.  I can also recommend to check out Post Hub (https://posthub.sws.siemens.com/#/kits) and the content provided in terms of fully developed machine tool kits, trainings material, best practice and the offering from partners as well.  I hope from 😡 angry smiley over a 😕 still not satisfied smiley we get to the point of a smiley 😉 . If not feel free to reach out to me anytime per PM and happy to set up a call to explain more in detail.  Best regards, Thomas  NX CAM Product Management Marcel0 Hello Thomas, As wood processors, we are the exotic ones who work with NX. We've been doing this since 1997. Back then, we chose NX primarily because of the consistency of CAD and CAM and the 5-axis options. Since NX does not offer modules in CAD and CAM for our industry, we have produced many programs ourselves with NX Open, UF and GRIP and PostPulider, including with CAM UDOP, such as saws and CalmexP, Lamello etc. This also includes post processors with CAM templates that are machine-specific. This also includes permanently installed units on the CNC machines in addition to the main ATC units, individually controllable multi-spindle heads, etc. So nothing that can be easily adjusted with PostConig. That's why we continue to rely on PostBuilder. For example, we still have problems doing the same things with HoleMaking that can be done with PTP. This would also mean that extensive adjustments would be necessary in our NX Open... programs! See on Youtube Also See ... And.. Our company is now 8 person. Everything was developed in-house. So we rely on long-lasting and reliable functions, including in the API area.😱 Burnzy Just another money grab from Siemens. Expect to pay thousands to unlock the full licence for post configurator if you want all capabilities. ThomasJ Hi@Marcel0​ , fully understood and it is great you are utilizing the API (from my perspective one of the most powerful features in NX to automate the process). Post processing is one of the major components to machining parts and I like to reiterate that existing PB posts will still run in the future. After watching the videos you shared, you are doing a great job and it shows the power of NX CAM, what you achieved already and the potential the software has!  I just can offer and you need to grab it: I am happy to consult, having a detailed discussion on your topics, understand the transition to new technologies (the reason why we developed Post Configurator) and the benefits/ value creation.  PM me and I will be open for a visit.  Best regards, Thomas ThomasJ Hi@Burnzy​ ,  I can understand your concerns regards the Post Configurator and pricing. I am speaking here from my personal believe and business perspective and not in the name of Siemens. Could you consider a product which give advantage to customers to give it for free? If you say yes,  I am heavily interested in your opinion why this should be for free. We have a great team around this and they delivering value to a lot of customers and partners already, clear documentation, user training, testing and quality assurance, continuous improvement, eliminating the pain points of post processing, standardized libraries for multiple controllers, not forget Post Hub as a new model for free to use post processors and as well paid full machine tool kits easily with a one click installation. We have people around it to drive our vision & reality of the digital twin.  If you say no, it's all about value creation. Does the PC framework give you an competitive advantage? Yes, everything is customizable, complex machining is easy to solve, constant updates on the libraries and be inline with NX updates and new features automatically implemented.  My bottom-line here, we can moan about pricing but finally it's all about the value we create in our day2day business and does it have positive impacts or negative for you as a customer/ user. The dream and I think I am living for it 😉, let's eliminate the issues in postprocessing and get it right the first time with less efforts.  But it has some costs to do it, and this is why we need some licensing mechanism.  As said, happy to connect and get your response and I like to encourage others as well to post their opinions here...Important topic!  Best regards, Thomas  NX CAM Product Management Marcel0 Hello Thomas, When you look at it as a customer it looks different. We buy a product that does a job. We then pay for “maintenance”. Which for me means that I will receive the product and its further development at a later date. But what happens here again and again is that product support is stopped for which people have paid for “maintenance” for years. Then a new product is put in place of the old one that you have to buy. It does the same thing but slightly differently. The price for which you have long since paid for with “maintenance”. If maintenance only contains bug fixes, why does it cost so much when bugs say: ""fixed next release""? ThomasJ Hello Marcel, for the postprocessing area I have to say in terms of the maintenance aspect that doesn't matter of Post Builder or Post Configurator, we have a continuous development in the Core architecture, as the underlying architecture is still Tcl for both, the reason why PB posts will work forever 😉. In the last years a lot of improvements was done in the Core so that even PB take advantage of those, introducing new mom-variables, new MOM commands, better performance. So maintenance not only contains bug fixes in this area.  With Post Configurator itself we like to eliminate one of the most common issues in the manufacturing space, you need an expert to develop the post processor. I have replied to your PM and let's get in touch to discuss further and let's post the outcome of the discussion together here, for all who have an interest in this.  Best regards, Thomas gkoenig My issue with the switch to Post Configurator is that it forces users to either spent an exorbitant amount of money with Siemens for a full PC license, or I need to establish and maintain an expensive relationship with a specialized vendor to maintain my post on an ongoing basis.  In my experience (both as an NX user in my own business, and my day job with a machine tool builder), post processors are almost living things, where users often find the need for minor changes, additional features as their capabilities/knowledge grow, or simple quality of life improvements. I've been at least tangentially involved in about a dozen post development projects for our machines with our customers - every single one of these projects only ever gets (at the very best) 90% complete. Fleshing out every feature in the CAM and machine tool side never gets accomplished because even getting to full functionality for most users has exhausted the relationship and budget by the time it crosses the finish line.  The great thing about Post Builder is that it always offered an escape hatch - users could spend a day watching the YouTube tutorials, google, and the MOM variable manuals to make minor tweaks on their own. No need to bother the vendor who is exhausted in dealing with your minor requests - just go save off a backup copy, tweak until you get what you need, and move on.  Post Configurator's licensing costs basically eliminate that escape hatch because the cost of that license is on-par with what entire competing CAD/CAM systems cost. It is an appropriate price to offer as a tool for vendors who will be working with NX customers to produce complex, custom posts. It is way beyond any rational ROI calculation for almost everyone else.  Potential solutions? 1- Node Locked Full Post Configurator Allow me full access to post processors tied to my NX site licenses. Any post processor I create with Post Configurator? Is tied directly to my site license and I can't resell them. If I want to get into the business of building posts for customers? I need to pay Siemens for the full Post Configurator license.  2- Redraw the line between Standard and Full PC licenses so I have complete access to a wide range of machine functions, but do not have full access to the kinematics or basic format. For example, let me configure coolant, work offsets, high speeed machining codes, canned cycles, UDEs. Core machine kinematics, advanced functions (tool center point control, tilted work planes), and other base machine specific items are not editable without the full license. ||| Marcel0 And what this means? 😕  ""...,but we strongly recommend that you switch to the Post Configurator platform.""

Best regards, Thomas  NX CAM Product Management Marcel0 Hello Thomas, As wood processors, we are the exotic ones who work with NX. We've been doing this since 1997. Back then, we chose NX primarily because of the consistency of CAD and CAM and the 5-axis options. Since NX does not offer modules in CAD and CAM for our industry, we have produced many programs ourselves with NX Open, UF and GRIP and PostPulider, including with CAM UDOP, such as saws and CalmexP, Lamello etc. This also includes post processors with CAM templates that are machine-specific. This also includes permanently installed units on the CNC machines in addition to the main ATC units, individually controllable multi-spindle heads, etc. So nothing that can be easily adjusted with PostConig. That's why we continue to rely on PostBuilder. For example, we still have problems doing the same things with HoleMaking that can be done with PTP. This would also mean that extensive adjustments would be necessary in our NX Open... programs! See on Youtube Also See ... And.. Our company is now 8 person. Everything was developed in-house.

Best regards, Thomas  NX CAM Product Management Marcel0 Hello Thomas, When you look at it as a customer it looks different. We buy a product that does a job. We then pay for “maintenance”. Which for me means that I will receive the product and its further development at a later date.

If maintenance only contains bug fixes, why does it cost so much when bugs say: ""fixed next release""? ThomasJ Hello Marcel, for the postprocessing area I have to say in terms of the maintenance aspect that doesn't matter of Post Builder or Post Configurator, we have a continuous development in the Core architecture, as the underlying architecture is still Tcl for both, the reason why PB posts will work forever 😉. In the last years a lot of improvements was done in the Core so that even PB take advantage of those, introducing new mom-variables, new MOM commands, better performance. So maintenance not only contains bug fixes in this area.  With Post Configurator itself we like to eliminate one of the most common issues in the manufacturing space, you need an expert to develop the post processor. I have replied to your PM and let's get in touch to discuss further and let's post the outcome of the discussion together here, for all who have an interest in this.  Best regards, Thomas gkoenig My issue with the switch to Post Configurator is that it forces users to either spent an exorbitant amount of money with Siemens for a full PC license, or I need to establish and maintain an expensive relationship with a specialized vendor to maintain my post on an ongoing basis.  In my experience (both as an NX user in my own business, and my day job with a machine tool builder), post processors are almost living things, where users often find the need for minor changes, additional features as their capabilities/knowledge grow, or simple quality of life improvements. I've been at least tangentially involved in about a dozen post development projects for our machines with our customers - every single one of these projects only ever gets (at the very best) 90% complete. Fleshing out every feature in the CAM and machine tool side never gets accomplished because even getting to full functionality for most users has exhausted the relationship and budget by the time it crosses the finish line.  The great thing about Post Builder is that it always offered an escape hatch - users could spend a day watching the YouTube tutorials, google, and the MOM variable manuals to make minor tweaks on their own. No need to bother the vendor who is exhausted in dealing with your minor requests - just go save off a backup copy, tweak until you get what you need, and move on.  Post Configurator's licensing costs basically eliminate that escape hatch because the cost of that license is on-par with what entire competing CAD/CAM systems cost. It is an appropriate price to offer as a tool for vendors who will be working with NX customers to produce complex, custom posts. It is way beyond any rational ROI calculation for almost everyone else.  Potential solutions? 1- Node Locked Full Post Configurator Allow me full access to post processors tied to my NX site licenses. Any post processor I create with Post Configurator? Is tied directly to my site license and I can't resell them. If I want to get into the business of building posts for customers? I need to pay Siemens for the full Post Configurator license.  2- Redraw the line between Standard and Full PC licenses so I have complete access to a wide range of machine functions, but do not have full access to the kinematics or basic format. For example, let me configure coolant, work offsets, high speeed machining codes, canned cycles, UDEs. Core machine kinematics, advanced functions (tool center point control, tilted work planes), and other base machine specific items are not editable without the full license. ||| ThomasJ In short it means, we strongly recommend for any new post processors, for example when buying a new machine or controller retrofit, to use the Post Configurator platform.

It was great, put all operations with proper parameters, select all holes on face by specified diameter range, and ready to go (just not great for 5 axes drilling..)Now we run NX2206 version, I am not sure how to proceed, if hole boss geometry or some feature based process. Honestly I always get problems with features and hole boss geometry, it is just so annoying and difficult to get something quickly done, most of the time the hole has different orientation, if I set manual inputs somehow in a different part they turn back to ""from geometry"", not to mention the multiple warning messages always pop-up.I appreciate any guidance here.","Reinier Capelle Hello.

I also spent some time trying to understand FBM workflow, so far it seems too complicated to get started, it is much more complex than old operation templates. We are relative small company and this will demand months of work to get started, but let's see  I just wanted to have my operations parameters set to desired thread size, but the new hole making cannot accomplish that as any user defined parameter will automatically turn to ""From geometry"" when copying and paste into new part. dennisP_146 We use FBM quite a lot and its very useful once its setup up in a good way.  Not only useful for threading holes but also drilling, milling, chamfers, gundrill, milling pockets etc.  However I do understand it can be hard to get into this matter. But I think with the available documentation from siemens you can get started with basic rules. Reinier Capelle You can achieve independency of the modeled geometry by setting “Use Predefined Thread Length”. This is the operation parameter that is persistent: Similarly “Use Predefined Depth” for the Drilling operation. Guilherme Vilvert Hi Reinier,  I will try this tomorrow.

On the other hand using the old nx drilling method, I just select all holes on surface and hit go, it is done. I used this a lot in the past with hole templates, I can't see an easy and fast way to do the same with the new workflow, as mentioned before, I can't even drill a hole.  the downside of old drilling method is 3+2 drilling, it cannot handle all in single operation, we must break down in single operations for each plane LarsOkkels(Siemens Employee) Please add the file in your reply directly.

Unknown if this will be machined on a vertical, horizontal or any-other machine configuration (I saw Grob advertising a config with the table upside down to improve chip evacuation).  The only machine context given in your part file is your clearance cylinder that represents opportunities for the ncm transfer. The ncm transfer will take the shortest, non colliding alternative.  In your case the one below is taken as it is shorter than the one going above.  Moving the cylinder axis downward a 50 you will result in the upper alternative be taken (as it has become shorter)  As you probably did not define the cylinder axis arbitrarily the option to add some geometry that represents your machine (and tag it as check geometry) would be an option.  I have quickly added a simple block to demonstrate the effect. The lower alternative will be rejected due to collision which leaves your preferred upper transfer as the selected alternative.

First make sure you have the kinematic chain fully defined that is includes both axis at the end B and C.  The function returns the B and C axis value to achieve the orientation of the input vector. Usually teh tool vector. In case the (vector) tool axis is parallel to the C axis the math will always returns C axis value 0.0 as any other C axis value will also solve the same math.

If the Feed word is set to modal then this would be normal behaviour, the feed word would only be re-stated if the value has changed.  To modify this behaviour you can add a force once at an appropriate point so that the value is forced out when it is next encountered, even if the value is not changed.  For example add the following to a proc in the End of Path to have the feed re-stated at each operation, where 'F' is the word that should be re-stated.

Typically, the Start of Path event contains a custom command that applies the MOM_force command to the various addresses you would want forced out when beginning a new operation to override the modality.

If your post uses a different word to output the feed rate, force that word instead. ||| arryan_p Hi Jason,  Yes, it is resolved, the answers are right from very first.

The operation could possibly be set to skip the highest pass or two at the top flat face of the part to avoid that cutting condition, but then you wouldn't be finishing that area of the part.  It would be hard to avoid that condition on that kind of geometry using only a ball mill in a 3-axis machine unless you fixtured the part differently."

Do we have a rule to identify when we set part to MCS, when ...to solid model.","JasonOtto There is no hard rule for this.  As a general guideline, though, the less geometry you give a toolpath engine to think about, the better and faster results you will get.  If you are machining only a portion of the part and the rest of the body can be safely ignored, only use those faces involved as ""part"" geometry in the operation.

As the robot control in NX is implemented as user defined event (UDE), it needs an object to be attached: operation, operation group, …. If an object is selected, the “Robot Contol” dialog should look similar to the picture from OOTB-example below. Now, you can create poses and save them with the “flash” symbol.  If the poses-dialog is not shown, check the dialog properties (top left in dialog window, left klick). Hope, that helps, Jörg nukEd Thank you Jörg! I allready figured it out.

It's post processor depending in my case. ||| JasonOtto Is this a post builder or post configurator post? What is the problem in the output exactly? Are you using the cutcom UDE or enabling cutcom within the operation parameters? Does the problem only appear with cutcom enabled?  In other words, if you don't have cutcom turned on, do you get proper helical output?  Also, note that NX2306 has added an option to output hole milling as a machine cycle:  If your post does not support a machine cycle event for hole milling, and you have this option set to Machine Cycle, you will not get output.

GMC does not support the definition of helical moves.  You may have mixed up the GMC and the GFO. The GFO (Generic Feature Operation) is a different operation type, that uses a similar concept (subops with expressions) to define a subprogram or cycle for a feature. It only defines the cycle/subprogram, the approach/departure/traversals are defined by common NCM/clearance options and the defined cycle/subprogram is re-applied on each feature based on its specific parameter values (think about a drilling operation where -instead of selecting a cycle- you define the cycle by a set of subops).  The GFO supports the definition of helical motions. Thanks,  Toon"

With a well developed machine as a user - my opinion is that ISV is integrated and much better to interactively help programmer visualize paths while creating programs. Vericut is probably more accurate since (last I know) solids are pixelized and not tessellated. Vericut would be better if multiple cam systems are used. Vericut costs an extra license/maintenance if you already have an appropriate NX cam bundle. I have always seen a value in using both. ISV along the development of the paths and Vericut as a final check if money is no object.

A user with experience in turning through FBM has to answer this. ||| Salvador Hello@gopinath_karthik7491​,  Your question is quite broad and the answer depends on the industry and designs you are working with.  If the parts you are dealing with mainly consist of holes and pockets, then you can automate the CAM programming of those features entirely. This means that FBM will assist you with the tool and operation selection. The feeds and speeds can also be automated if you have Machining Data Libraries.  However, if your parts are 3D shapes, they are a bit more complex to scope in your FBM implementation.  Cheers,  Salvador  ||| Reinier Capelle Hello, NX CAM customers who apply FBM for turning have all extended the set of recognized features to cover the scope of their parts.  OOTB recognition is limited to axial and radial grooves. NX CAM has the capability of teaching your own custom features. gopinath_karthik7491 Thank you for your response. We are hoping to learn how to create some custom features for turning. There is a lot of documentation for milling, but i feel there needs to be a little more on turning. ||| gopinath_karthik7491 Thank you for your response. We are hoping to learn how to create some custom features for turning. There is a lot of documentation for milling, but i feel there needs to be a little more on turning. ||| dennisP_146 Hello,  I agree with@Salvador​ here. When certain features like simple holes/pockets are very common this can save quite some programming time and also keep consistency in how to machine certain these features. Especially in mold making this can save a lot of time since here are a lot of repetitive features. Some simple plates we can program for 90% with FBM, of course checking the output of FBM is always necessary.  If you want to mill/drill features correctly PMI is of course a must, to also keep into account the applied tolerances.  However depending on how the rules are setup up and how broad they are (and of course how many rules you have)  it can be time consuming to adjust/optimize these rules. LarsOkkels(Siemens Employee) ""If you want to mill/drill features correctly PMI is of course a must, to also keep into account the applied tolerances.""  PMI, surface colors or face attributes is a must yes. dennisP_146 Indeed, surface colors or attributes together with feature mapping is also a solution if no PMI is available. ||| LarsOkkels(Siemens Employee) ""If you want to mill/drill features correctly PMI is of course a must, to also keep into account the applied tolerances.""

Have you run check geometry on the part? Select it by rectangle to also check faces and edges. ||| frankjs(Partner) Hi@Stefan Pendl​ Thank you for your quick answer, I think like you that the problem is in the collision check. I don't know how to manually separate the cut ranges, the operation is an area milling so the collision are everywhere and separate it manually seems imposible.  Regards Frank ||| Stefan Pendl Sorry, I overlooked the area milling operation, I thought it was a level-based milling operation.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O000061xRRQSA2/what-is-the-best-practice-to-avoid-small-cuts-during-restmilling,What is the best practice to avoid small cuts during REST_MILLING,"In NX 8.5 we have always used the previous part stock value as the minimum removed material value to avoid small cuts with the REST_MILLING operation and 3D IPW.Now with NX 10.0.3 MP14 we get a warning that there might be cut levels skipped due to the minimum removed material value being greater than the maximum cut depth. To our surprise the message was correct and there have been cut levels skipped, that would have resulted in the tool to cut the depth of three or more cut levels at once, which in turn would have resulted in the tool being turned into crap.What is now the best practice to avoid small cuts when using the 3D IPW for REST_MILLING?Thanks in advance for any pointers into the right direction.Attached is a sample from NX 8.5 with programs with and without small cuts.If you generate the tool path in NX 10 and above you should get the warning and the missing cut levels.","hayaler   I opened a topic about this issuebefore.Mysuggestion is that use your minumum material value as close as possible your depth of cut value. ||| Stefan Pendl The problem is that this is a simplified body, the original is more complex due to the shape that is property of our customer. As you can see from the image attached, we need to get rid of the cuts marked red. Having to use a different setting depending on the cut depth was not satisfying in the past for more complex shapes.  ||| hayaler I understand you,I showed problem on an easy part before.İf you dont want to unnecessary passes on part you should use bigger min material removed value than previous operation depth of cut value.But problem is that İf you do that,some levels can be skipped according to your min material value.  So use safety value for min material value than edit unnecessary tool paths on part with tool path edit😀 ||| Stefan Pendl  So use safety value for min material value than edit unnecessary tool paths on part with tool path edit😀 Tool path edit for a complex part is very cumbersome and time consuming. In addition you have to do it each time the design changes. This is really not a useful way for the future. We really need something that can be used without user interaction in the future. ||| SvenV In situations simular like this one, I've set the stock value a little higher.   Also using IPW level based seems to help... ||| Stefan Pendl  In situations similar like this one, I've set the stock value a little higher.  Yes, currently this seems to be the only way to get rid of the possibility to crash the tool and/or the machine. With the entire shape that was removed for this example, this needs a much bigger difference to get the expected result.   Also using IPW level based seems to help... This seems to be only reliable if the depth of cut is nearly the same for both operations, the previous and the rest milling one. Would be nice to have one solution that is capable to succeed for 80-90% of the parts where such a strategy is needed. In NX 8.5 and lower this was the case, now we have to rethink many of the established work-flows. A really fast preview of the tool path to expect would make it easier to check the result of using one or the other solution before one generates the final tool path. In many cases using a bigger depth of cut is not showing the short-comings of the chosen strategy. ||| SvenV I think that the origin for al these problems is the IPW resolution.  I tried changing the needle distance/count but that didn't seem to help, also don't fully understand what they do and if they are still used now that chordal tolerance is added.  Create the IPW using verify tool path with the choral tolerance set to 0,005mm Then when u generate the rest milling operation the IPW form verify tool path is used and the results are much better without having to change stock or miniumum material removal values.  I also changed the in/outtol settings to 0,005mm.    Maybe with the new IPW update in NX11.0.2 this wil be easier... ||| Stefan Pendl Thanks for taking the time to propose and test some solutions guys. Still not happy about the need to use workarounds, since I hear my users complaining. Other parts of this project have about 200 operations, where the majority needs about 30 minutes for tool path generation and a few even 6 hours or more. Going tighter with the in-/out-tolerance would increase the tool path generation times drastically, so not really an option. Anything that needs special handling will not survive, since users tend to take the short-cut. A more accurate and reliable IPW would be much appreciated. ||| jure.demsar8292 Hello,  Has the problem been solved/improved after seven years?

We use the NX software for programming our CNC machines, and the ""shop documentation"" feature to provide detailed information about the machining process and the tools to be used. However, we have recently encountered challenges related to a lack of information, especially regarding the determination of the minimum Z in each operation.So far, we have been unable to identify a specific variable that provides this information accurately. As an alternative, we are manually entering this data, often obtained from the post-processor. This manual approach, besides being prone to errors, can result in the transmission of incorrect information due to small oversights by the programmers.We recently acquired a 5-axis machine, which requires a more detailed description of how the piece will be secured and which devices will be used. Unfortunately, we are facing the same difficulty in finding a specific variable to include these details in the ""shop documentation."" Therefore, I request the collaboration of anyone who can offer suggestions or information on how to efficiently integrate these details.I appreciate in advance the attention and availability of everyone.","KJH Hello Luis,  Have you tried to post process using the ""Review Tool"". Go to the location you posted out to and look for  *****_debug.out. The variable mom_tool_minimum_length was found. This is in version NX2306. Hope this helps.  With Best Regards, Siemens NX CAM Support Kevin Hickey   ||| Luis Vedoy Dear@KJH​,  I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share that I tested the mentioned variable, and it performed its function effectively. However, the only observation I have is that it does not display absolute values as per the program. It would be beneficial if it could show both positive and negative values, if possible. Additionally, when using the variable in drilling operations, I noticed that it does not display values. If you have any guidance or suggestions on how to address these issues, I would appreciate it. ||| Stefan Pendl I think the OP would like to have the lowest Z value of the tool path and not the minimum tool length. There is no variable that holds the lowest Z value in NX. The only way currently is to let the post-processor output the lowest Z value based on the tool axis. For shop documentation, you would have to build a utility using the NXOpen API and call that to analyze the tool path. ||| Luis Vedoy Hello@Stefan Pendl​ ,  That's exactly it—I would like to automate the retrieval of the minimum tool value in each operation and integrate it into the ""shop documentation,"" as it's widely used in my workplace.  I've been looking into the ""NXOpen API."" I've never used it before, and neither have any of my colleagues, but I noticed that programming is necessary to make use of it. I'm not sure where to start with this operation, how to call it, and how it relates to the ""shop documentation."" If you could clarify some doubts, I would be grateful. As for the programming aspect, I plan to delve deeper and attempt this type of work because it seems quite interesting.  Thanks for your assistance! ||| Stefan Pendl If you have never developed in anything like C# or any other of the supported languages it will be hard. I personally have never had a need to show the lowest or minimum Z value on the shop documentation. I have searched the community for ""minimum Z"", including the quotes, and had some hits. I also have never analysed the internal tool path using NXOpen, so cannot help here too. The easiest was always to get the information from the post-processor. ||| Luis Vedoy I understand that the most practical way to obtain the minimum Z value will be through the post-processor. As I mentioned earlier, this sheet is widely used where I work, and I would like to transfer this data there without having to do it manually. However, it seems that the only viable option will indeed be through the post-processor. Thank you all. If anyone manages to accomplish this task at any point, I request that they share it here. Alternatively, if I succeed on my own, I will provide an update so that these details are available for anyone in the future who may need them. PeterGM You can save minimal Z in post, and then create an attribute for an operation to save it (appears in opertation information after first post of nc code).

However it is only showing about half of part it is machining.Should I use a different toolpath for this?I though about wall profiling, but since it is at an angle (and on 3 axis VMC) I figured I needed a bullnose endmill in some type of contour toolpath.I also need a toolpath to cleanup the radius between the wing wall and main ring o.d. if anybody has suggestions.Part is machined and on fixture now, everything is done to part besides last zlevel profile toolpath.Thanks for any help with this, I am kind of under gun to complete it this week, but thats another story, haha.Thanks,Mike","Keith... Hi Mike  I have made some changes to your part and uploaded the file. ZLevel Profile is the operation that I would use to cut this part. The part is not being machined all the way around because the part is ""undercut"" on the area where there is no toolpath. To force the software to cut this I turned on ""Continue Cutting Below Tool Contact"" This alone did not fix this so I also added the top chamfer to give the software more geometry to follow. To avoid this being cut I have used Steep Containment set to 85°. I have also selected the ""wing"" surface to produce a cut at this level.

We use the traditional turning operations to generate Y-axis operations as well.  What we currently working with is to provide documentation and best practice material for how create the FreeTurn / Y-axis turning tools and what steps are required in the cam setup.  We will soon be able to share a post configurator layer for Sinumerik ONE which support the new CYCLE805 that is developed to handle Y-axis turning.  Next steps we will be focus on is to extend the post layers for more controllers and also update CSE simulation to support Y-axis turning.  Hope you are happy with this answer.

Having a documentation for best practices on this area will be really helpfull.  I understand that there are no limitations on this area currently.  Why I ask for a robust solution: 1 - Currently we have to manage multiple MCS´s (at least 2) to create the Y axis turning. One MCS for the regular turning tools and one 90 deg rotated for Y axis turning tools to be able to use Tool Path Animation in a realistic way.  There are no plans to allow turning operations on MCS YZ plane?  2 - Currently all tool tilt/rotation we have to manually set. There are no plans to develop a function to automatic tilt? Something similar to Tilt Tool Axis on milling operations. This will be useful for live B axis turning as well.  Thanks. ||| krzewicki(Partner) Hello,  I dont undertstand why you create another MCS.  Look at my picture. I created toolpath in stnadard way, but in simulation I have implemented Transormation, which rotates MCS. Thats why I have still X Y address - like on real machines.   This is very easy to do on MCF.  If you have question, write to me.    ||| Anton Persson Hi@NX CAM Beginner​  To answer your questions.  1 - No plans at moment to extend the Turning MCS to support also YZ plane. 2 - No plans at the moment for this either, but I agree with you that it could be useful.   @krzewicki(Partner)​  For the post output and machine simulation it´s as you show here possible to use the traditional G18 ZX plane also for programming the Y-axis toolpath. But to get a realistic tool path animation so that the tool axis is pointing correctly related to the Machine Kinematics. Then you will have to rotate the MCS 90 degree.   Best Regards Anton krzewicki(Partner) Not exactly,   Mazak controller provides special G-code for rotating Coordinate system.  As I mentioned I  implemented under this G18.2 tranformation in MCF. Completly like on real machine.   ||| krzewicki(Partner) Not exactly,   Mazak controller provides special G-code for rotating Coordinate system.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O00007uE7GgSAK/barrel-tools-and-finishing-complex-surfaces-in-nx,Barrel Tools and finishing complex surfaces in NX,"I've used NX for over 25 years now and I'm very disappointed on NX lack of progress on new technologies in NX Manufacturing. Specifically, I'm looking at milling complex surfaces with Barrel End Mills. A technology that allows for huge CNC machining times savings over a traditional Ball Endmill machining. This technology has been out for a few years now. Other much less expensive CAM systems make use of Barrel End Mills so simple that within a day you can figure out how to use them. Meanwhile NX has very little support when it comes to that type of milling. It seems that all effort is on Aerospace Blade milling and everyone else is left behind.To be more specific, the only way to use barrel tools is to use Contour Profile with Surface Area. We all know that using Surface Aera for Drive Method is a painful and outdated process that requires your drive geometry to ""magically"" chain - a method that often fails on simplest geometries.Unfortunately, other drive methods are not supported when using Barrel Tools. There is also no option for the system to figure out best tool axis angels to optimize the tool path - which requires constant adjustment of tool axis and tool cutting contact as the surface tangency changes.With that said, does anyone out successfully uses Barrel Tools for machining/finishing complex surfaces? If so, would you be able to share your experiences?At this point I am seriously considering moving our engineering programmers to another system as lack of simple use of barrel tools is a key in our medical field of machining complex surfaces.  Some of our sister divisions already moved away from NX because of that issue.  Not sure how long I can hold on to this system.Appreciate all your opinions...JerryNX 1892","Ashish_Joshi Hello@jerry-m​, Thanks for your patience. We appreciate your business and your feedback on requirement for straight forward barrel tool operations. We have been actively working on developing standalone swarfing operations for 15 months now. Good news is that we are targeting this December release NX 2312 for releasing the wall swarfing operation, and then targeting releasing floor swarfing shortly thereafter. Fillet Finishing after we release Floor Swarfing.  Please find attached information about the 2 operations below. We have been doing machining trials for pass year and results have been promising. That being said, would you like to provide us a test part that we can create and show you the toolpath on with barrel tools?  If you join the EVP OR Trail Blazers Test Program we can give you immediate access to wall swarfing operation for yourproduction environment. If you have questions, feel free to ask please.

It's saved me a couple of times when I wanted to do something that none of the other tools could produce, and the fact that Siemens keeps it around (and legacy tools like it) that have code that haven't been touched for 20 years is one of the reasons NX is so powerful.

I just can´t find the way how to do it. I changed the type of motion under machine control. Also played with intol outol values. I have no clue, it seems that nothing I change brings NX to do circular movements. In about 5 cm there are nearly 100 path points but it should be done with one arc/circular motion as the radius is constant.I also tried to change things in post configurator that have something to do with arc motion but all the changes work only in mill_planar operations.I am using the multi_axis_roughing operation with end mill of 3mm.So how can I achieve this? Is the end mill instead of a ball end mill a problem that could cause this?","JasonOtto It appears multi axis roughing is a surface-contouring based algorithm, meaning that the path itself does not contain arc moves.

All we would expect to get from this is a code file of G01 type linear moves.  There are no post changes or updates that would affect this behavior.  The issue is all in the original tool path.  I am not aware of any way to get arcs from this operation type.  All we can do is try to manipulate the GOTO point distribution to reduce or smooth out the points produced.  You already touched on adjusting in/out tolerance.  You can possibly customize the Max Step parameter onto the operation dialog and try adjusting the step value to see if that affects the distribution of points along the tool path, but that's about all I can think of right off.  If we can't adjust the number of points, perhaps the feed rate can be modified up/down to at least help make the machine motion less jerky when running it? nukEd Thank you for your input! So as I allready thought the post processor is not as clever as I would hope. So if I want arc movement they should be allready in the path, good to know. If I change intol/outol values the path is less precise but still linear moves. I found the ""max step parameter"" with other operation but not within multi_axis_roughing. can you confirm this?  I changed the mill tool to ball end mill but the path does not change from linear to circular motion.  Can you think of some other operations that can do the thing?

ToolingBall 2.9MB mike.williams9026 Yes, thanks! ||| mike.williams9026 Yes, thanks! ||| ToonVDK Hi Mike,  I am not sure what you exactly want to do, so I am going to do a wild guess and assume you -amongst others- want to drill a 1/4"" tooling ball hole on a location where you also intend to machine a counterbore hole. As the counterbore hole has a different angle compared to the tool ball hole you are not able to reuse the recognized hole and instead want to machine at the same location (through center of counterbore hole but with direction aligned with the mcs zaxis).  There are probably multiple ways to achieve this. I will try to sketch one...  I have (CTRL M) gone to modeling and defined a point in the center of the counter bore hole Switching back to CAM (CRTL + ALT M) I have created a drilling operation with a 1/4"" cutter and specified my geometry by selecting the point (not the feature) from within the operation (alternatively use a Hole Boss Geom and select the same point) and thereby created an ""independent"" NXHOLE feature at this location with tool axis aligned with the z of the mcs (and not aligned with the z-axis of the counterbore hole that is at the same location).  Just trying to interpret your intent, apologies if I am way off on what you intend to achieve ...  Thanks,  Toon mike.williams9026 No you guys are both spot on, thanks.  It's a little tricky for me to figure out model manipulation that way.

As a consequence the last one will not be aware of material removed in previous operations.  If you do activate Find Related Features for RGH_718_CBORES and FINISH_718_CBORES (and check the result within the Machining Feature Navigator) you will get ""tagged"" NXHOLE's for the first operation (RGH_718_CBORES) and ""recognized"" Counter Bore Through Holes for the second operation (FINISH_718_CBORES) You can create a feature Group for the ones selected by your last find feature action (all Counter Bore Holes) and then move all 3 operations below the newly created feature group () to ensure all machine the same machining feature (You can also use a HOLE_BOSS_GEOM group or make sure that -from within the individual operations itself- you always select the same machining feature for all 3 ops) This will invoke the Create Feature Group Dialog. Press Create Feature Groups at the bottom and OK. Switch back to ONT afterwards to see the resulting FG) Second issue: Good this will make the last operation aware of material removed in previous ops but this will not help you in this case as the RGH_718_CBORES does not rough out all material, leaving a tool point. Consequence is that the infer of the start diameter returns with 0.0 (as at the bottom you will need to remove from 0.0 (tip point) to cylinder).  So 3th issues, your start diameter is 0.0. You can define/override the start diameter manually and set it to 0.01 less than the diameter (while all in process features selected to have it applied on all)  After OK, On toolpath generate, it will complete without warnings ...

Unfortunately, HEIDENHAIN has technical concerns about general simulatability and has also issued a statement:  ""HEIDENHAIN considers the provision of your source code for simulation of the measuring cycles to be critical. Such a simulation cannot reliably simulate the movements of the TNC controls. There is always the risk that the user will be led to believe something that does not correspond to reality. A reliable simulation can only be achieved by using our control kernel, for example with a virtual TNC. In addition, newer cycles are usually very closely linked to the NC software, so it would not be technically possible to provide meaningful source code.""

Long story short: They do not have a KUKA.CNC post. You can pay for accelerated development (which souldnt be too expensive) but I didnt. I am sure KUKA does have some PP which would be obtainable, but due to the fact that I am trying to get this for free I had tough luck.  I am currently working on modifying the Sinumerik RMR post, which fundamentally delivers very comparable results to the desired ISG syntax. I think that I am very close but there are still some issues I will have to figure out.  If you want to DIY this like I have done start by making your machine model by mimicing the KUKA kinematics from the examples withing nx manufacturing.  I'll keep you updated."

The value for the#variablescomes from the operation feed rates during programming.  As an example, let's say you have these values for feed rates in your operation:   In the post, you have assigned#variablesfor each of these different feed options, and you have set the master Feed Linear option to ""Param"" instead of the default of ""Value"" as below:   Now, when you post, the top of the operation gets a table of feedrate#variablesassigned the values from the operation feed rates. Then, those#variablesare used to output the F word value for the various moves:  (FLOOR_WALL_TEXT , TOOL : UGT0201_096)  N12 G0 G53 Z99999.9 N14 T05 M6 N16 #21 = 111. (ENGAGE MOVE) N18 #22 = 123.

So, you aren't really assigning or getting these#variableparameters within the post. The post is simply using them to assign the settings from the operation and calling them whenever the F word is output in the code.  Hope that helps clear things up! "

Added this to the attached video. WorkFlow2 9.8MB ||| mike.williams9026 That makes sense, thanks.  The  Wave geo linker basically replaces part, so you can work with it, but if geometry changes on original part, all you have to do is update original part, and the toolpaths for the most part update with it, is that correct? ||| RL Hi, That is pretty much it. If the design file is from NX the CAM assembly part will be associative. If one of your Customer's sends in a new Step file with changes the Replacement Assistant can be used to re-associate the faces. You need to have a Wave Link to do that. There are other benefits. It is good to get into the habit  of using it."

(edit: should be possible to call it from PB_CMD_before_motion instead if you add logic to see which motion event is running and return if it's not MOM_circular_move or MOM_helix_move)  Useful variables: $mom_corner_control_circular_feed_comp_flag = 1 (adjust feedrate on arcs is set in the operation) $mom_cutter_data_output_indicator = 1 (cutter compensation is ""contact contour 2D"") $mom_minimum_circular_feedrate_compensation_factor (min compensation factor from operation) $mom_maximum_circular_feedrate_compensation_factor (max compensation factor from operation) $mom_arc_radius (radius of arc) $mom_arc_direction = CLW/CCLW (use it to determine if arc is ID or OD) $mom_cutcom_mode = LEFT/RIGHT (use it to determine if arc is ID or OD) $mom_tool_diameter = (diameter of tool)  If the tool is ""user defined tool"" then $mom_tool_diameter cannot be used. $mom_tracking_point_diameter is useful in this case.  Good luck aloturco Thank you for the insight, we do use ""output contact"" for cutter comp. If you turn this off, feed rates are adjusted. ||| aloturco Thank you for the insight, we do use ""output contact"" for cutter comp. If you turn this off, feed rates are adjusted."

I was on a business trip.  Every CAM system requires the information of tool tip and tool mount on a turning tool. This comes not for free and is necessary if the downloaded solid tool doesn´t have this information included. Orientation of a tool in space can also be different in other cam system and does not always align with the orientation of the downloaded solid tool. Based on your answer this seems not to be the issue here.  So your requirement is basically how to add multiple tools into the library quickly?  Exporting/adding the tools into the library can be done manually one by one, as described in the best practise guide. Or If you like I can share a NXOpen script with you which can export all tools in a specified folder into the library.  If you are interested, please send me your mail via PM.  Thomas"

Expanding a bit on what@SteveV​ mentioned: since you recently mentioned you are new at this, I'll share an important point to remember:  You can use an old NX release with a newer License File, but the reverse is not true: You cannot run a newer release of NX with an older License.  In your case, and license for NX 2306 can run NX 2306 or previous releases, but will not run NX 2312.  You should have received your new NX 2312 License just before it released in December, and seems you have not installed it yet.  Once you have the NX 2312 License installed, you can still use it to run NX 2306 if needed.  Please contact your Support Channel for more details or if this does not solve the problem (e.g. in case there is something wrong in your new License File, they can get it re-generated for you). ||| John_Vincent(Partner) FYI, there is a known issue for users with CAM-only bundles in NX2312 that Synchronous does not work. Siemens development is working on a resolution. My case, 10954385, has not been converted to a PR yet however. ||| Pat McManus Hi@John_Vincent(Partner)​ !  I thought the CAM bundle case was resolved a couple of weeks ago and licenses were already re-gen-ed.  But that's why Steve and I asked the OP to check with Support since I have no way to know what products they have, to be sure it's not a new case (and they should not share a S/T or Webkey in a pubic forum). ||| İbrahim Bereket The licence installed on the computer is 2312 licence. When using NX 2306, there is no problem when using synchronous commands, but in NX 2312, the error in the image is received. ||| SteveV This is related to an issue related to your specific licenses. As stated earlier, please contact the support center so that they can analysis your purchased bundles and correct the issue. "

I have been making a new Workpiece every time I switch between them. I then set the IPW source as the last Milling or Turing operation. Is this the correct practice? Ideally I would just have one blank, and all the operations/MCS would be underneath it, as I do when only Milling. I tried doing this but the IPW doesn't update correctly when switching between Milling and Turning. I then have to go back and manually update the Source IPW (not sure why it can't be automatic) if I make changes upstream. This seem very tedious. I am fairly new to the turning module BTW.Is there a better way to do this?","NX_USER_61 Here is my structure for a B axis millturn with lower turret.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O0000825NPjSAM/query-list-of-available-kinematic-chains,Query list of available kinematic chains?,"Hello,We are working on a CSE simulation project in NX2206 that requires the use of multiple tool-changeable right-angle heads on a 5-axis milling machine. It could be described as using many sim09 adapter devices but modeled at different angles (when loaded into the spindle, the tools point in various directions).When the devices are loaded, we need to use the new concatenated kinematic chain ex: ""A-C-X-Y-Z+ADAPTER"" for tilted working plane and TCPC functions. The problem is, when we have multiple devices loaded all with the same chain name ex: ""ADAPTER"", I run into issues using the kinematic chain. I start getting errors about ""kinematic chain ""A-C-X-Y-Z+ADAPTER"" doesn't exist"" or ""missing holder component in kinematic chain ""A-C-X-Y-Z+ADAPTER"""". When only one device is present, it works fine.This has led us to the strategy of using a different kinematic chain name for each device. The only problem is, we are not sure the best way to get this information. I first thought to use ""C_"" + the name of the head as a chain naming rule, but this breaks down if the same head is duplicated in the CAM file (because the name gets ""_1"", etc.).So, is there an undocumented function or anything to get a list of available kinematic chains from a loaded device? This would be really nice. We've considered using also the machine kit editor, but in NX2206 this causes an internal error for head devices.John","Modulus I have had great success using several different right-angled-heads within a single CAM session by using a combination of AC language and the existing CHAIN+ADAPTER transformation as you have described. The trick is to ensure the correct tool and device is activated before invoking any offsets or transformations. This can be done with a single chain plus multiple adapter configurations. I use thegetHeadOfTool(getToolNameByNumber(nToolID))within a modified version of the sim09 ToolChange.prg file. This gets assigned based on a reserved set of pockets that I have identified as RAH pockets for a particular machine. Let me know if you need any more info, would be happy to share.  Cheers,  -Grant Modulus CAM JHutchison Hey Grant,  Interesting, my experience is not the same. I wish it was! If I use device name ""HEAD"" for example with chain name ""ADAPTER"", it works fine. When I add another instance of the device, named by NX ""HEAD_1"", it still has the chain name of ""ADAPTER"". I'm calling ""A-C-X-Y-Z+ADAPTER"" as the GV_strSwivelingChainName for each one. When we mount ""HEAD_1"", getCurrentHead(<CarrierName>) and getHeadofTool(getToolNameByNumber(<ToolNumber>)) both return ""HEAD_1"", but I get the alarm that the kinematic chain does not exist.

You can either teach the Feature with a PMI Note, or insert this in the recognition code in the FBM Configurator. Examples can be seen in the recognition code for BOSS_ROUND_STRAIGHT. You will need something like this:  parameter('FACES_CYLINDER_1')=role([Cyl1]), parameter('FACES_CYLINDER_2')=role([Cyl2]),  You must add the FACES_CYLINDER_1 and FACES_CYLINDER_2 manually to the class of the new feature.

G10 L2 P0 (fanuc),"Dear Community,In Fanuc control you have a way to define the Work coordinate system in the program. This overwrites the register in the controller. One step further.. with CAM the positions are known, because you have the machine-simulation. In this case you don't even need to determine the coordinate systems in real life.So I am looking for a way in PostConfigurator on how to return a list of coordinate systems, with positions. Has anybody done this already and wants to explain how they did it?More information on what I mean:In Fanuc you haveG10 L2 P0 X[x]Y[y]Z[z]A[a] (shifts all coordinate systems)G10 L2 P1 X[x]Y[y]Z[z]A[a] (definition of G54)In this case I set the Main (P0) on the centerline of the rotary axis:And it's position is:So you have G10L2P0X357.95 Y11.

Below are two identical tool path but use local offset shifts.  I've attached a basic example part and post.   new_post 788KB ||| michael.linder7708(Partner) Hello John,  Thanks for your reply. I see, yes G68.2, I'm formiliar with this function. (Not yet in postconfigurator so thanks for that). I agree for one part with a vice or a chuck that clamps in the centre G68.2 is great.  The thing is, when I look at it from an operators perspective.. when you have multiple parts, with a narrow tolerance, the difference is noticeable. It is annoying that everytime the coordinate system is being called the shift comes along. So when you need to change an individual coordinate system (manually), you have to scroll through the program. But when the coordinate systems are defined in the top; you only have to change it one time. So I want to accomplish it for that situation. Offcourse an upside is that you can change the part position and because of the shifts everthing comes along and the machine still knows where the part is. Anyway thats another interesting discussion. Thanks and I keep looking for the G10 possibility.   Kind regards, Michael Linder   ||| Tushar Kulkarni Hellomichael.linder7708,  See attached image.

You will likely want to set some variable to represent when you want this type of output to be enabled and disabled and use the value of that variable as the condition for the callback. The procedure specified by your callback can output the template you are creating and force XYZ for the upcoming linear_move.

Its different than my request.  Best Regards. ||| ThomasF Hello,  the variable B axis option is available only for finishing operations but not for roughing. https://youtu.be/QfVeE6LvYtY?si=HVY2MH58hu8MsMiG  For rough turn operations you can specify a static angle to tilt the rotary axis (e.g. B Axis).  I´m curios and would like to better understand the requirement why you think its necessary to apply the variable B axis to rough turning tool paths. For heavy roughing applications the b axis of a machine could be damaged. Therefore usually the rotary axis is locked when using the rough turn operations. When it´s variable you won´t get the stability in the machine which doesn´t allow a high cut removal.  Many thanks for your feedback!  Thomas CAMasochism One application that I have seen is using R style inserts and rotating the B-axis back and forth while roughing using as much of the exposed cutting edge as possible to get the maximum amount of life from the insert before having to turn it around. gsen Thank you very much for your support 🙂 ||| CAMasochism One application that I have seen is using R style inserts and rotating the B-axis back and forth while roughing using as much of the exposed cutting edge as possible to get the maximum amount of life from the insert before having to turn it around. ||| gsen Thank you very much for your support 🙂 ||| Mike_R I think part of the issue here is what we are calling roughing. I have seen roughing operations with 3 LNU6688 inserts in a row in the holder taking 2.5"" DOC and watched a 400 HP stall. I have also seen medical customers definition of roughing as taking a .050"" DOC. Most HRSA turning operations are usually in 3 stages. 1st stage is roughing and I would want a fixed B Axis, second stage machining is developing the shape of the part and that would be where I want Continuous B axis or Y axis turning start to be available as we are talking multiple cuts but not high depths. Of course for finishing you would want both options available."

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D5KZ000001bVO00AM/replacement-assistant,Replacement Assistant,"I've posted about this before but I wanted to re-visit as I have a milling operation that would benefit from some sort of part family programming. Previous engineers here typically import step files directly into a manufacturing file as a body. I've extracted geometry for that part, added a component which is a different size part of the same family which happens to be a mirror of the current part. I then use the replacement assistant to link familiar faces and edges, make the new component the workpiece and try to regenerate toolpaths. I've got to be doing something wrong here as toolpaths need complete reselection, and I have a couple questions.In order to get this to work to get toolpaths to regenerate using the same surfaces and edges, does the extracted body need to be the part that was selected for toolpaths? In other words, since I'm adding the extracted geometry from the imported step file body, does that extracted geometry need to have the selected faces/edges for the initial toolpaths for the replacement assistant to transfer over?What is the process once  I get to the replacement assistant and get edges/faces matched up? Do I then select my new imported component as the workpiece? Or should this be the new linked body?  Is this where my problem is because the initial program was programmed from the STEP body?Sorry if this doesn't make sense its hard for me to explain but I'd really like to get this replacement assistant to work. Turning multiple part families is a breeze with NX but trying to do part families in milling is a chore that I feel I'm doing wrong. Thanks.","Stefan Pendl The result is not only depending on the replacement assistent, but also on the selection indent of the geometry. Since you do not use a real part families, where you have one parent part with a spreadsheet that controls all the child parts, the way you match faces and edges will be a more manual work flow.  Turning is a very simple job in respect to geometry and cannot be compared to milling. Burnzy I initially did geometric, then I manually accepted each edge/face making sure they were correct and then from there I used generate from accepted, again manually accepting every edge/face.  Is the typical workflow for programming milling to re-select every toolpath when programming part families that are different sizes/mirrors of each other? Stefan Pendl If the selection intent cannot collect the entire area, then it is a manual task. Since you are working with STEP files, there is no way to get NX recognise any relation between two parts. ||| Burnzy I initially did geometric, then I manually accepted each edge/face making sure they were correct and then from there I used generate from accepted, again manually accepting every edge/face.

Mill_AREA Mill_BND etc. This way you can have multiple operations for roughing / semi finish / finishing and you only select geometry one time. Using Geometry objects such as planes, points and datum csys will also help with this process.  Burnzy I do like this suggestion, I'll keep it in mind in the future.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D5KZ000001bwfm0AA/how-do-you-maintain-your-am-machine-park,How do you maintain your (AM) machine park?,"Hey AM community,As you surely all know, the maintenance of machines is crucial to ensure their efficiency, reliability, and safety. Compliant maintenance not only contributes to increased productivity, but also to the profitability of a company.Therefore, my question: How do you maintain your (AM) machine park?AM? In this context, AM stands for additive manufacturing. At toolcraft AG, we established our additive manufacturing department in 2011. Currently, we have 13 additive manufacturing systems (L-PBF, DED) with numerous additional peripherals. Maintenance is therefore a significant and crucial aspect for us as well.Initially, we carried out our maintenance using analog methods with manual documentation. Errors, delays, limited accessibility, restricted data utilization, and paper chaos were daily challenges. In our search for a modern, digital maintenance solution tailored to the requirements of an additive production environment, we discovered that there was no suitable application available.And now? We decided to develop our own solution!After numerous internal sprints and feedback loops, we created a low-code application on the Siemens Mendix platform.The advantages of our digital maintenance solution are diverse:The application can be used both as an app and web based.We were able to save at least three analog forms per machine, making the process not only more efficient but also more sustainable.Thanks to the application, we always maintain full transparency and oversight of all machines.Furthermore, digital data collection allows for internal processing of information, crucial for enhanced traceability, especially in terms ofcertificationand standardization.Since we have other manufacturing departments in addition to additive manufacturing within our company, the goal is to implement our solution across the entire enterprise. So far, we have integrated more than 100 machines and peripherals, and many more are set to follow.Some other benefits we believe this application offers is:It isAM-specific, for example, it can answer questions like: How many build jobs can I schedule before reaching the maintenance condition?It is also suitable forall other manufacturing areas(machining, injection molding, mold and tool making, etc.).How do you find this solution? Would this solution help you?What else would you like to see from this solution?Feel free to share your own experiences in the field of maintenance management.The exchange of best practices and challenges can be enriching for everyone. Let's discuss together! I am curious …",

I have attached an example presented on this forum previously. It contains a few GFO examples, one with a drill break chip/deep pattern (operation name DRILL_BRKCHP) that alternates between break chip and chip removal (Retract for chip break OR removal, see picture).  It will give you sufficient insight in the possibilities of GFO and provides you with a starting point to easily modify and customize it into your own drilling pattern.  Thanks,  Toon  Cam_dev_gfo_2 283KB James1642423626472 Hi Toon,  I've found the supplied file really useful to help me create a  similar operation. Can you explain how the indexC and indexT variables are defined and allowed to be used in the expressions please? indexC appears to be a loop counter which I am struggling to create and utilise for my scenario. With the a modified version of the supplied part, my 1st cycle performs as expected. If I regenerate and run again, the 1st move in the loop goes to the final depth as the loop counter hasn't been reset and the value exists in expressions. Can this counter be forcefully reset before the loop to ensure that the variables are all as they should be when starting the operation?  Thanks,  James  ToonVDK Hi James,  Good to hear that you can make use of the example. The GFO path processor is based on the same path processor platform as the drilling, thread milling and other hole making operation types. It will iterate over all features (defined withing Feature Group or Hole Boss), generates a subprogram for each location and adds standard traversal types using common clearance geometry.  The main difference is that -instead of generating a ""built in"" subprogram- it generates a customer specific subprogram. This delivers the possibility to define customer specific path processors for a wide range of applications like drilling, milling, probing, et cetera applied to an unlimited set of feature types coming from different sources (recognized, identified, tagged with ad hoc set of attributes), using an extended range of tool types.   Defining your own subprogram means that you need to take care for your subprogram logic errors. Common mistakes are:  (Within this sample the loopvar is defined by the name ""index"" where indexCiterates from 1 to indexTand indexTis defined by the formula ""ceil( Depth/step_depth)-1)"" All data will be reset for each location (for each feature), recalculated based on tool, common and location specific feature attribute values and this includes the loop variables. The loop variable indexT will evaluate to different values in dependence of the feature value (in this case depth) so it might be that it evaluates to 1 on your second location???  For comparison, the given example part file shows a gfo peckdrilling example that produces the same path as the standard drilling operation within this part, same goto points but with different attributes (dwell, feedrate). The GFO sample is parametrized with the same parameters as the built in drilling cycle I hope this helps.  If you're not able to figure it out then I am happy to have a closer look into your specific example. It will be interesting for others on the community as well! If your example does contain propriety data and cannot be shared then I would advise to contact GTAC to have it shipped to us.  Thanks,  Toon James1642423626472 ToonVDK Hi James.  As you assumed, the value within the expression view shows the value after iteration (so their value appears to be equal, though it is not during iteration).  I will need to have a look into your example to have an explanation for what you're describing. Are you sure that you only use indexC and indexT on subop moves that are children of the loop subop?  Looking forward to have access to your example. As an alternative to the GTAC route you could consider to copy your GFO operation to a dummy part ... (assuming your GFO does not require propriety data protection). With some hints on dimensions of your features (if holes then depth value would suffice) I would be able to replicate ...

Can it currently be compared to Adaptive Milling? Is it worth getting for NX or is the adaptive milling of the NX components sufficient?Can you share any insights etc.?Thank you","hjoy (Harri Joy), SCC @PaLi(Partner)​ , please not that I haven't used iMachining, so this is my impression and what I've gained from videos. Before NX got adaptive, there would have been a huge advantage because of the high speed milling and hard material capabilities.  In the current form of NX you get good adaptive paths, very similar to what imachining offers. What you don't get is ""iMachining Technology Wizard"", which claims to take the guesswork out of speeds/feeds/stepovers/depths etc. If it works, it is still a valid selling point, because NX lacks any proper offering in this are afaik.  Back in the days when NX didn't have adaptive I got a quote from Volumill and it was pretty horrific. Don't know about the pricing now, so you'll have to ask.  Harri John_Vincent(Partner) I agree with@hjoy (Harri Joy), SCC​ , both iMachining and Volumill have technology calculators which are nice. They operator in different manners however, I prefer the Volumill option myself.  From a pure toolpath standpoint, I would not spend the money on either; 3D Adaptive is so nice in NX2306. ||| John_Vincent(Partner) I agree with@hjoy (Harri Joy), SCC​ , both iMachining and Volumill have technology calculators which are nice.

CAMster From what our IT guys says it was not a big deal to install Voulmill.  It is much, much more than just speeds, feeds & stepovers. The way the path is generated in Volumill is nice. It maintains a constant chip load and works better at bottom up. Don't get me wrong. The adaptive milling in NX works fine in most cases and the tool life is great.

Imachining is way ahead of NX Adaptive and Volumill. We have used all of them. Imachining runs circles around both if set up correctly. Neither Volumill nor Adaptive calculates instantaneous tool load based on the ultimate strength of the material you are cutting. Adaptive and Volumill do something similar, but they're not the same. Stepovers are defined as cutting angles in Imachining, which is counterintuitive initially but makes sense once you dive into it. You also get true uniform scallop heights during roughing, which neither software does well at this point. We stopped using Volumill and Adaptive in the shop. The time savings just speak for themselves. We routinely cut volumill machine times in half. Ping me if you need more info/demonstration or a quote. Imachining is priced reasonably, I think. We like it so much that we recommend it with every NX CAM seat we sell! PaLi(Partner) Thank you Zoltan,  Our customer is deciding between NX CAM and SolidCAM.

Since they use SolidWorks and 2/5D milling, they lean more towards SolidCAM. They are currently acquiring 5axis machines and comparing SolidCAM and NX.

Unfortunately, if I were to present it this way to our customer, he would choose SolidCam. ||| Zoltan1561535009855(Partner) NX is a better CAM platform overall i think. Especially in 5 axis. There is a lot to gain with imachining for NX and NX cam. I can make a more refined tool path in NX. It is also more stable. But that’s a SW issue.

Plunging a round (off the lathe) boss into a Rectangular boss.We have also found Optimize Feed Rate tool to be quite useful in other operations.The Plunge Milling operation has available the “Optimize Feed Rate When Generating” check box and the values (on the Feed and Speed dialog) so we would like to apply feed rate optimization to this operation as well.Our problem is getting this to behave as we expect. In feed rate optimization two critical values are“Nominal Cut Width” and “Nominal Cut Depth”Our Plunge operation is set to1.500in  Maximum Distance for the Stepover0.125in Step AheadAnd we are plunging 2.00in deepWhat should our “Nominal Cut Width” and “Nominal Cut Depth” setting be?I would think “Nominal Cut Width” would be  the 1.500in Stepover and “Nominal Cut Depth” would be the 0.125in  Step ahead. But this is not outputting proper values I get the “Maximum Feed(%Cut)” value on all cut’s. Cutter just starting into the Boss (very minimal engagement) or even when fully 1.500in engaged I still get the “Maximum Feed(%Cut)” value.Cut depth on a plunge mill operation is actually irrelevant but I even triedNominal Cut Width = 0.125Nominal Cut Depth = 2.00andNominal Cut Width = 0.125Nominal Cut Depth = 1.500All I get output is “Maximum Feed(%Cut)”Is this “Optimize Feed Rate” broken for Plunge Milling or is there any info about what setting of the plunge mill operation translate to the “Nominal Cut Width” and “Nominal Cut Depth”Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.Jim,HOW DARE U have you got the answer?

Reinier Capelle Hello Dennis,  First of all: thanks for responding!  the new Create Feature Process is a refactoring. In other words, a different implementation that does the same thing. With a few functional improvements as Stefan pointed out.  Indeed we need to know:  dennisP_146 i am using NX2306 but note that we do have some customization (custom tool attributes) in our tool library. These custom attributes are used by FBM.  With the feature toggled off I don't get any output from FBM, with it turned on it works normally. I included the information window I get when using FBM with the feature toggle turned off. FBM - information 24KB Stefan Pendl I would open a support call at the support center and supply the FBM XML file and the entire tool library folder including any customization to the ug_library folder. This will allow Reinier to take a look at the issue and to correct it if this still needs fixing. Reinier Capelle Thank you for the information log file.  Many valid rules are filtered and that is why you get no solution. This is a known regression in NX 2306 and it is fixed in the upcoming release NX 2312.  A workaround - either temporarily or permanent -  is to use leaf tool classes instead of abstract classes in all the Machining Rules that are mentioned in the log file:  The following rule(s) are not suitable for any of the loaded tools : MILL_GROOVE_AX_CIRCULAR_RECT_ROUGH MILL_GROOVE_AX_CIRCULAR_RECT_SLOT  etc. etc. ||| Stefan Pendl The main differences of the new create feature process are the support of utilizing existing feature groups without creating additional ones, in addition there is the ability to only create the process for the first hole and add similar holes to the process without creating a process for each individual hole and then checking if it can be merged into an existing feature group.

We have few postprocessors for Heidenhain, Siemens, OSAI for ""gantry"" type CNC-Machine, with limits for C-axis (-240...240, -270...270). But solution not so easy. We analyse for each point limit for 4th axis and if next position will outside of limits - we insert reposition motion (Retract, A=0, New C inside limits, new A, engage). See a video:   ||| Ken_A I ran into this on another machine/control type. The problem is that one of the ""*_prev_*"" is not reset by the Rotate UDE, so the post still thinks the ""closest"" rotary position is the one it moves to in line 36.  So, as part of the proc MOM_rotate, you have to reset the variable(s) involved. Offhand, I don't remember exactly which one(s) it is, but try - mom_prev_pos(3) and (4) - mom_prev_out_angle_pos(0) and (1)  Possibly others (you can use MOOG_Show_globals proc & look for variables with the ""old"" values) ||| Ducaero I appreciate the replies. I was able to get it working by replacing the Heidenhain MOM_rotate custom command with the Fanuc MOM_rotate custom command. I'm not sure what the difference is other than it fixed the problem. ||| iMachiningGreg I know you resolved your issue but in the future if you would like to resolve this without creating a new UDE.

This will allow you to set the Diameter, the C-Sink Diameter and the Tip Angle.  You wrote: when I set the C-sink diameter in the add-on, it doens't work Can you be a bit more specific: - Does your hole have a modeled top chamfer or are you trying to machine a chamfer that doesn't exist in the part? - What Machining Area have you specified? - Did you set all the feature.ChamferHole parameters or just the C-Sink Diameter? - What exactly doesn't work?

Thanks, Kai ||| CAM_Jockey Hello,  I have raised a IR in the past because the chamfer milling on un-modelled chamfers does not work as expected it was converted to a PR7463466 with a priority code of 2 serious.  When selecting the hole you want to define a chamfer on it doesn't put the correct size on there and if you have multiple chamfers selected it would alter all to the same even if they have modelled chamfers?  It is still open at the moment I found this when running through the learning advantage training on the subject.  Might be something along the same line as you are seeing. ||| Tom1607550694420 Hi Dave,  Thanks for pointing to that PR. We're looking at it now to determine if this could be related.

Kai ||| Tom1607550694420 Hi Dave, Hi Kai,  We took another look at the PR that Dave mentioned. It shows a difference in behavior between NX9 and NX10 when using the FACES_CYLINDER_1 machining area on a group of features, some with and some without a FACES_TOP_CHAMFER.

The trick in CSE is to ensure that the main channel rotary axis is set to SpindleMode - AXIS, and coupled to the calling channel. You may need to use DetachJoint, AttachJoint, and SetSpindleMode to fully implement this in NX. Sync manager will force the machine code output before being able to sync, so any CSE errors will get hung up as you are experiencing.. Check out our video showcasing this and many other capabilities (1st video at 25 second mark). https://ModulusCAM.com/media-gallery  -Grant Clemo ||| Modulus frankjs, To add to previous message; The C-axis polar output can also be achieved with this same implementation.

Except that the machine Z- Axis is horizontal and not vertical.The customer uses CYCLE800 with Mode 54. Which means rotate CSYS in order BAC.The issue im having with CSE is that the table rotates not in all cases.For example CYCLE800 with B and A angles defined swivels on the real machine the head and rotates also the table. But CSE swivels only the head.Is there a setting to achive this behaviour or could it be something else I´m missing?Im not sure if it has something to do with the IKS Solver, because it returns only 1 solution?Changing _DIR form -1 to +1 has no affect at all in this case. But on the real machine it does.I did no modifications on sim09 cse_driver execpt TC_CARR.DEF and TC_KIN.DEF.Here I used the value from the arc file. So I would say they are corrrect. KIM model corresponds also to TC_CARR values.My previous fix for this issue was using the rotation from $P_WPFRAME. But this implementation doesnt consider the 2 solutions CYCLE800 provides on the real machine.Any help/ideas would be really appreciated.Best,Max","Thomas_S Hello Max, that is a topic of the solution picker or more exact about the solution provider. The core command CalculateIKSAngles can not detect such differences, as it provides the axis solution to bring the tool axis vector in the requested orientation. In such casesanyC axis positon will be correct.  To handle that we have a function, where you can try to customize/influence and force to get two solutions defined and provide them to the solution picker. The expirence shows this is a good place to interact, but will never solve any use case of any machine (customization may be needed).  Please check the methodCalculateSwivelingAnglesdefined in the fileCSEBasic.py. In that case the target tool vector is parallel to the part axis - in your case the table axis C - an additional solution is set e.g. 180.0 degree  Hope this helps"

I don't think this behavior can be changed. If you print the output through a external text editor, the result should be similar to the old one. ||| Broady The following was explained by GTAC when this question was asked:  ""Beginning in NX11, the info window does have a different look and feel.  This means different fonts, some hidden formatting characters, and other aspects of what it displays.  This is not changeable.  It was never intended for users to create output, like shop docs, NC code, etc from the info window - it is intended as an immediate echo of the process output for the user to look at.  I've seen similar issues when users try to save the posted code from the info window and run it on the machine.  Formatting is all messed up and the control rejects it.  We may have gotten away with this in previous versions, but no longer.  The info window is not a plain text editor and its contents are not what we have gotten used to in the past.  The shop docs function will create actual output files, either txt or html, depending on what shop doc option was chosen.  I would advise using the real output file as the source forprintingor other use.  Use the info window as just a visual verification of what the shop docs output file will contain.""

For Rest Milling and Cavity Milling operations you have containment IPW options ""Use Level Based"" and ""Use 3D"", which on their own provide a good result. Adding a reference tool kind of conflicted with the IPW options, so it was decided for robustness (as the PR stated) to remove it from the dialog.     Steve Curtis I added in the Reference Tool to my Rest Milling operation. What I notice is that without it, the tangent point of the small tool does not meet up with the tangent point of the previous larger tool. I changed the default intol/outol from .003 to .0005 to get it as close as it is shown below but it still does not truly meet up. If I define a reference tool, I can use the Overlap Distance to extend the start point of the smaller diameter tool past the tangent point of the previous larger tool as shown below.  Juraj(Partner) I think floor wall operation has the same issue, you cant set overlap/extension for such cases. planar mil has overlap parameter for this when using 2d ipw or reference tool. ||| Steve Curtis I added in the Reference Tool to my Rest Milling operation.

I don´t know if this is the most straightforward solution as it requires some set up work... But the solution i see is to create a custom attribute for the tool classes you´re using which specifies for which material the tool is to be used. You can then use this attribute in rules for the tool selection process.  This link should provide some information on how to create custom attributes for the toollibrary:  Manufacturing General (siemens.com)  Hope this helps.  P.S. I used this approach to be able to distinguish roughing from finishing tools. ||| Reinier Capelle Hello Dennis,  in addition to Robert's suggestion, you can also:   But that is a check afterwards and will give a performance degradation linear with the number of candidate tools you have in the library. If a selected tools evaluates this condition to false, then Create Feature Process backtracks and tries the next candidate until it finds one that evaluates to true.

I've looked in all the setting on the left side of the Floor Wall dialog box, in my Workpiece settings, in my Method setting under Path Settings as well. ||| Keith... @TSchlager​  I have had a closer look at this and these operations can be a bit of a mine field to work through as there are a lot of settings and options. They have fantastic capability but you need to understand how they work to get the best out of them. I really like the ramp by depth and would love to see it added to Planar Mill operations.  For a bit of background information: It can be a bit confusing to work out what operations to use but these operations ARE ALL THE SAME but with different customised dialog options. This means that all the operations can give the same result by adding options from Navigator -> Right Pick on Operation -> Object - Customise...   I'm guessing that you are using 2D Profile WITHOUT Floor, this does not have the Cut Region Containment option. I suggest that you use 2D Profile WITH Floor.

I ran the Examine Geometry command and the solid body is fine.What could be the problem?","Stefan Pendl For examine geometry, be sure to select the object with a rectangle, so all edges and faces are selected too. The solid might be fine, but the edges and faces might not. In addition, if you display the geometry in such a case, you will see white dashed boxes around the objects causing the issues. Cesare Hi@Stefan Pendl​ ,  I always select all the entities with a rectangle and flag Set All (check). The problem persists even if I use the Optimize Face command. What I don't understand is whether the error is related to the CAM or to the model. Thanks anyway. Stefan Pendl It is an issue with the model. For CAM the model will be converted into a faceted body internally, where it can happen, that this conversion does not entirely succeed. Edit the operation and display the geometry, then you will see white boxes around the problematic areas. ||| Cesare Hi@Stefan Pendl​ ,  I always select all the entities with a rectangle and flag Set All (check).

The perfect example is the P2P vs Holemaking operation, I don't want to compare computing time (P2P is the winner) but the user interface, what a great feeling when windows open quickly, no latency but it's off-topic... Alongside this, Nx has become more attractive, with a nice interface and nice visual effects, I think to be more attractive to new users. Don't try to compare the different versions, you'll go crazy (I've stopped doing that)."

I am using the Output Contact Data option. My question is, do the surface normal vectors come from the drive surface only? What if a tool is contacting at 2 points? I am cutting turbine blades that have a hub (floor) and blade (wall). Which normal is being used? I will investigate by creating the vectors based on posted data and comparing to the model, but was hoping someone could shed some light on this.","RL Hi, From NX Help: When using 3D cutter compensation, you need to use a small enough tool so that there are no double contact points, as illustrated in the figure above by the number 2. If the path contains tool positions with multiple contact points, the system will warn you that it can output only one of them.  https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20221117716122093.mfgmilling/id755569"

I cutsomized my GFO, but I don't get the values from the two points that I set in the expression list.Have anyone an idea why it dosn't work?Thanks Christian","Marek_Klos Hi Christian, At the moment in GFO we can only work on existing features, tools, own value attributes. None of the points selections have representation in the expression list. That is what the development team has to consider to enhance the operation for additional options. We can use Generic Motion operations for selection points, but I can imagine You'd like to parametrize your ""measure cycle"" and GM will not work for you.  To summarize, NX has to remove those selection options to avoid misunderstandings (GFO customizable item is the same core as Generic Motion, that's why you can find those options in GFO, but without any possibility to set them) However, enhancing GFO for selection points is something that we should seriously consider developing.  Thanks, Marek Juraj(Partner) Hi, I checked posthub and I found there some layers for probing cycles - Is that the future for measuring on machine? I believe that GFO is for feature machining with tool/feature parameters, not for probing. Thanks Marek_Klos Hi Juraj, Yes, we have ready operations on posthub for ""on-machine probing"". This what you found is additional layers for postconfigurator for correct reading the toolpaths. Most of the provided on-machine probing operations are based on generic motion operations. In GFO you can parametrize your own cycle, using probe as a tool, and support measures within features. Holes are the best example to utilize GFO for measuring cycle ToonVDK Hi Juraj,  Multiple options for programming probing cycles, probably best to look here  https://posthub.sws.siemens.com/#/resources?locale=en_US or check out the alternative released with 2306 https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/On-Machine-probing-in-NX-CAM  On a side note, GFO can be used to program probing paths as well as cutting paths. A GFO requires a feature context where a feature has a CSYS in which space the (cut or probing) pattern is defined with motion using expressions based on the feature (and tool + custom) attribute values.  These features can overlap with recognized machining features but could also have been defined manually by tagging to a point on a surface (without any relation to a machining feature).

Opening a file created in an earlier version (2206, I think), this functionality works just fine, even when opened in 2306.I'm guessing there is a template setting that 2306 pulled that is keeping this from happening?

I copied the Carrier + Pocket configuration from a perfectly functional part file where all of this works just fine.

It isn't that I can't drop a tool into a pocket - I literally cannot initiate the drag behavior to reorder or move a tool. Operations held under the tool drag just fine and can be moved from one tool to another, but the tools themselves are basically fixed.

You can use the example data provided as a basis for building your own databases.  Am I right saying, that this means that tools, holders, etc. are strored native.

In some other warning messages, there's an option to avoid seeing the warning in the future, but the one you show does not have that option.

It is still throwing the same alarm or message. ​ I do not know if my observation is correct, is this related if your workpiece is a solid object or just a sheet body?  If I make the workpiece a solid object no alarm or warning message happen, but if it is a sheet body the alarm is happening. (???)  Tried to make it only one Workpiece (Sheet Body) alarm is happening when use some of its face as the cut area.  Tried to make one Workpiece (Multiple Solid Bodies) No alarm.  Is it required that your workpiece is a solid body? if it is not a solid body you cant generate multiple Z level operation at once?  Is this normal?  We just want to use the latest NX version because of its new features, hope there will be a solution to this.  Thank you.  ||| Edwin Hi,  Please report a PR so that we can make sure the problem get fixed properly. This is a checking issue of zlevel operation when the part geometry is sheet body type. ||| sanji Hi, ​ Just an update. Got a solution from Siemens support. ​ When selecting a part geometry. ​ Part Geomerty = Face Cut Area = Face ​ I tried also ↓ and it is  ok. ​ Part Geometry = Solid Cut area = Face   Part Geometry = Sheet Body is not reommended. this gives a message when generating Z level operation with Cut Area = face.

I'm a new user and I realize this system has a steep learning curve, but it feels like the source of my issues is inconsistency in how NX responds, not the steps which I take to get there.Originally, I had installed NX using all the default installer settings; installing NX toC:\ProgramFiles\Siemens\NX2007After a few write access errors and inabilities to save templates, tools to a tool library, and a few other issues I cant remember at the moment, I asked some people at my company if I had installed NX incorrectly.A few users had reported that when they went through training on NX they were told to install NX outside of program files to prevent write access errors as well as a myriad of other issues.However, I've also talked to several users who don't change anything in the install wizard and install their NX toC:\ProgramFileswithout any issues.The question is, has anyone heard of anyone installing NX outside of program files and for what purposes?If I had to guess this may have been an issue with NX12 and under, but may no longer be necessary.    Is this the case?Thanks,Tony.","Stefan Pendl NX can be installed into the program files folder, when you keep the configuration separately, which is strongly recommended. If you install NX outside of program files, you can configure NX using the files shipping with it, but you will have to remove the read-only attribute from the configuration files. For easy migration from one release to the other, you should keep the configuration separate from the installation. The community offers the NX_Custom package for this as a start, search the customization forum for it. We use NX since 1985 and have it installed in the default location under program files. The configuration is kept separately on a file share, so any user has the same base settings, and no one needs to configure things twice."

I am using a JT file from a different CAD system. My goal is to be able to replace the models when rev changes occur, and retain associativity in my toolpaths.I am curious if the workflow is similar to using a linked body, where I update the source of the linked body? Or is the JT treated like a component inside NX?Or is Teamcenter required to achieve something like this?","Broady Hi@Glenn Balon​  I would suggest creating some test data to see how your toolpaths update.  I've added the 'NX Manufacturing' topic to your post to get it in front of the CAM users.  Import JT Files ""When updating a part imported from a source JT file, NX can maintain the associativity in limited form only if the original JT and the updated JT both have exactly one body.""  The following is some general information I found in the docs regarding the associativity with respect to imported JT data:  JT Files If you have parts that were derived from JT files that were saved in a previous version, with 2212 JT associative features, NX continues to update these as before. NX displays these associative features in the Part Navigator.  We recommend that you set the Associative Updates customer default to On so that NX creates parameterized JT associative body features that maintain associative references.  JT data in NX for multi- CAD One of the key components of the NX multi-CAD functionality is the ability to create and retain relationships or associativity between objects in NX parts and objects in JT parts.  Pat McManus Hi@Glenn Balon​ !  There are a number of varibles that impact this behavior.  First, which CAD to JT translator do you use (and from which CAD). Most Siemens translators (and most CAD sources) will carry ""moniker"" info in the JT so that most topology changes can be tracked when a new JT file appears (when running native a CD will control the update).  If you are working with just piece parts then this may work OK in native. But if you have an Assembly, Tc is required to maintain the associativity between the assembly members.  The general workflows and settings are covered under the MultiCAD topic in the Tc Integration Advanced heading.  This does not require any use of Link.  Of course, you can always create  WAVE Link, just as you would with a STEP or IGES or other file, then manually re-map the new BREP when something changes, but that's extra work. Glenn Balon Thanks,  We will just being using a simple single body model with no assembly.  I see that I can update the model from the file>properties, but it only seems to work if the JT file has the same name. We alter the filename for each iteration.

We are using JT files from Creo.    Pat McManus Hi@Glenn Balon​ !  Yes, to ""Update"" the JT needs to be same name, and same location (essentially ""over write"" but you could copy the original somewhere else if you need a backup copy).  If you are using a non-Siemens JT Export from Creo, from what I've heard (no personal experience), there is no moniker support. So it will ""update"" but the entity IDs may not stay consistent.

Although I remember that some caveats are listed in older NX version about graphics cards settings, which can cause trouble on Verify 2D.  Hope this helps Jorge. Hi Thomas, I am using the Tool Path Animate but the graphics are way better when machining molds and using small ball mill as small as .015"" in diameter. I am wondering if the graphics can be better with Tool Path Animate. When i finish running the animate it looks image pixelized not smooth at all even after being analyzed. I can provide pictures if you need. hope you can help me out. ||| Jorge.

How to turn it on?,"LarsOkkels(Siemens Employee) Hi Psokol,  Some releases ago we moved the Operation Navigator to a new framework, which allows for better future development. This work was kicked off back in NX2007  Back then the ""New"" Operation Navigator was part of EVP, where users could provide feedback. At that time, it was still possible via a Customer Default to switch back to the ""Classic"" Operation Navigator. With the ""New"" Operation Navigator framework, the dependencies has never been available, and the feedback we got from users didn't suggest this was something pressing to work on, compared to other new capabilities. With NX2306 the Customer Default to switch to the ""Classic"" Operation Navigator has been removed.    psokol Hi LarsOkkels,  Thank you for answer. I have to admit it is strange to see this feature removed. Dependencies panel let me reduce constantly switching between views looking for members and parent objects. It wasn't best solution, but it worked. (By the way, good solution IMO would be adding some kind of merge program view, with ability to display member objects in tree view.) At the same time there are introduced features with questionable functionalities - like recently used objects in operations (you can't save layout, so there is no point for using this - its better to create custom templates) - to speed things up. I don't understand these moves, and more and more often I feel some regress from version to version. My feelings about new ONT: All the rest doesn't affect my work like these. I believe it applies to most users. ||| psokol Hi LarsOkkels,  Thank you for answer. I have to admit it is strange to see this feature removed.

Cavity Mill or 3D Adaptive, and why?","I just confuse which one is better to use, so anyone please help me to choose which one is better?","Ashish_Joshi Cavity Mill 3D Adaptive Roughing  Both operations support generally similar type of tools such as Flat end mill, Bull nose, Chamfer tool, etc.  A couple of distinct uses cases are slots and concave corners to highlight differences in the cutting method for both operations.  Concave Corners: Offset Roughing/Cavity Mill:When cutting concave corners like below with Offset Path the tool can embed too much in the stock material which can risk the tool and workpiece and hence not productive.  Offset Roughing Path  Tool Embedding into Concave Corner  Adaptive Roughing: When cutting concave corners with Adaptive Pattern the minimum curvature radius can be assigned to the toolpath due to which the tool cuts with specified radius and maintains near constant cutting conditions and avoid tool embedding. This keeps the tool and workpiece safe and feed rate can be optimized appropriately.  Adaptive Path Eliminate tool embedding with constant engagement cuts Minimum Curvature Radius option to control cutting volume Slots and Open Pockets: Offset Roughing:When cutting slots or open pockets with Offset Roughing, tool embedding cannot be avoided many times as shown below.  Cavity Mill - Follow Part/Offset Path Tool Embedding into slot Adaptive Roughing:When cutting slots and pockets with Adaptive Roughing, the Adaptive Pattern ensure that tool embedding does not happen as shown below.  Adaptive Path ﻿NO Tool Embedding with Adaptive Pattern  Bottom Up Cutting: In Adaptive Operation stock is machined near non-steep areas FIRST and then stock on the steep areas is cut with Bottom Up Cutting sequence upwards towards top of the stock. This allows cutting with most of the flute length when using long carbide end mills.  Considering above general differencesCavity Millcan be safely used for material where tool embedding won't hurt the tool or workpiece. Or can be used anywhere in which the path doesn't cause tool embedding.  Adaptiveis appropriate for hard materials like hardened steels, Inconel, Titanium, etc.. where tool embedding has to be eliminated for success. BUT can be used for any material, and situation depending on the use cases, available tools, hardware, equipment, know-how etc.  More differences below Cavity Mill 3D Adaptive Roughing  Please see documentation links below for more information Cavity Mill https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20220512394070742.mfgmilling/pcmill_cav_intro 3D Adaptive Roughing https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/209349590/PL20220512394070742.mfgmilling/xid1978137  Thanks, Ashish.

As you point out, choosing the right CAM configuration matters.  If you are not running MRL for your tool and machine libraries, do not use the 'mrl' variant of the cam configuration files.  You will want to choose a mixed mode type of configuration that points to the native NX machine library, such as the cam_teamcenter_ascii_library.dat file you have found already.  Regardless of what cam configuration you have in use, all the files for the machine must reside in TC.  This means you have to manually import the machine assembly to TC so that the managed NX session can load the files into the setup.  The attached pdf will be of help here in getting the machines/devices imported correctly.  I hope this helps out! TomK76 Hi@JasonOtto​  I just came across your post and that document.Importing NX CAM setup into TC  On page 2 of that document, it is mentioned, that all components of the machine should be ItemTypeResource.

Best regards, Thomas    JasonOtto Hi Thomas- Yes, machines will work if their components exist in TC as plain 'Item' types.  It is best practice to put things in their proper place right from the start, though.  TC can be particular about item types in some cases, even if there is a bit of leeway with this situation today.

I have tried using the Experimental Curve Additive Buildup component, however the results were not as expected.  this is becase The curve is divided along its length into layers. So a planar curve will be divided into lazers segments equal to a defined length.Has anyone experience with importing curves for motion paths_Thank you","Sara S If you only have a foundation face and a curve, you could try using Freeform Additive Coating. In the Main tab, select your Foundation Face and Guide Curve. In the Strategy tab, change Pattern to Infills Only, turn off Extend Drive toggle, change Stepover to Number, and Number of Stepovers to zero. This will give you one pass directly on top of the specified guide curve.

Hence we would say that the bottom level with one circle is correct toolpath and wont be able to machine more than it is.  With the operation ""3D_ADAPTIVE_ROUGHING_NORMAL_IPW_COLLISION_CHECK_OFF""(Picture 2) even though the toolpath looks correct and complete, the HOLDER collides with the IPW on top of the bossas IPW Collision Check is set to OFF, and hence is a wrong and unusable toolpath.  Let us know if you have questions and thanks for your time. Ashish.    dennisP_146 Hi Ashish Joshi,  Thanks for your reply! I see that from the pictures you removed the first toolpath which is important in this case. (this toolpath removes the materials which is colliding).  Im trying to show that OOTB it tries to check against IPW. which only works correctly (looking at previous operations) if IPW is turned on in the operation. Hence top material is removed. (see ''REMOVE_MATERIAL_TOP_FACE'')  since the top material is removed so there is no collision in your picture 2. The only option to achieve this toolpath right know is turning IPW on. Which might be an option you don't want to use. In the legacy adaptive (and other operations like cavity mill) you could simply turn of ''check for IPW collisions''. this way you never have to regenerate your toolpath if this is the outcome you want.  You can still achieve this by manually adding this button (RM--> object -->customize). So basically my question is, why isn't this button included by default?   ||| dennisP_146 Hi Ashish Joshi,  Thanks for your reply!

Then you need to update the FBM rules, so the change is read. Afterwards you will be able to select the missing attribute in FBM Configurator.  I have created an enhancement request to add all tool class attributes to FBM Configurator, so you might request this too at the support center to raise the customer count to get a faster implementation."

Is it advantageous if we move from this approach to master model approach ?",We're a Tractor and Farm Machinery manufacturing industry.,"MakJo Managing model, drawing and NC code in the same part (.prt) file increases file size. This eventually reduces performance even if you have good computer. Managing model, drawing and NC code in seprate part files (.prt) reduces part file size and different people (teams) can work simultaniously using the same model file.  As you are in Tractor and Farm Machinery, your product assemblies might be huge (in terms of file size and number of components), so seperting in different files makes it easy to work for each individual, differnet teams.  I would reccommend to move to master model approach, but slowly starting with smaller products sub assemblies or parts. ||| Enix Hi@MakJo​, Thanks for your response. But i have one more question. How to attach a file which have NC tool path/NC code under an item revision? In the doc ""Teamcenter Integration for NX"", they mentioned NC tool path can be attached under item revision. But, it would be helpful if u show with any example. Thanks in Advance. MakJo To manage NC files under Item Revision, there are two ways.  1) You can have stand alone NX CAM, generate NC Code and post process the required CNC code as per machine control, store it locally. Then add this file as a 'text' dataset manually under item revision. ---In this method, you need to export the 3D model out of Teamcenter each and every time, create local master model, have seperate part file for NX CAM toolpath generation.  2) Create NX CAM integration with Teamcenter. This is in addition to normal NX integration. In this way, you have additional item type under which NC code is stored after you post process in NX CAM. --In this method, You need to configure many things. So check with Siemens or their partner in your area about it. Enix Sure, I'll check it. But u're saying that for attaching NC Code under an item revision an additional item should be created under the item revision and under that item NC Code is attached . Is my statement correct? Do u any document regarding this? If u share. it would be helpful. MakJo NO.  If you configure NX CAM with Teamcenter, a seperate item type is used to store CAM related data. In this item, design item is referenced and NC code it stores under the seperate item.  I do nothave dcument for this but I am sure if you ask your Siemens vendor or Siemens representative, they will help. ||| MakJo To manage NC files under Item Revision, there are two ways.  1) You can have stand alone NX CAM, generate NC Code and post process the required CNC code as per machine control, store it locally.

Coming from a smaller shop (file/assembly size is never an issue) where I do everything from design/programming/drafting myself this is not a benefit for me. A couple of things that I do like about using this method are revision control and wave-linked geometry. When I import component from our customer supplied models (in a seperate file location for all customer supplied models), if the revision or model changes - it should automatically throw flags when I open that file. The wave-linked geometry can still be done without the master model concept but I still see it as a positive using this approach.  That being said, no engineer before me has used any master model concepts or even assemblies, just imported parts directly into the files. Both work but have to be handled a little bit differently depending on which setup you're working with."

This allows the NC programmers using the CAM licenses to be more focused on the complex parts that take a lot of planning and attention.However, the methods available for programming the simple parts on the shop floor are usually out-of-date and more prone to error. The machinists are often required to either use the controller conversationally or write the G-code by hand, both which are heavily input driven and time consuming.Also, many job shop companies don’t purchase modern CAM software for this use case for two main reasons:·        Cost – it’s overly expensive for the nature of the work being done·        Ease of use – the CAM software can be overly complex for the desired outputIf this practice somewhat describes your shop’s workflow, read on.We, at Siemens, are developing a new cloud-based CAM product that is simple to use and focused on the detail work usually programmed by machinists on the shop floor. This software will guide the user through a workflow to get the desired G-code output as quickly as possible to get the CNC machine tool running sooner. The cloud-based product is accessed through an internet browser and requires no downloads, which means it can be used through multiple devices with web access such as a PC, a laptop, and even a tablet.This new cloud-based software is compatible with NX for more complex programming tasks. This allows you do simple programming in the cloud and if you need more advanced options, simply open the .prt file in NX and continue on with the work.If your shop has a need for this type of cloud-based CAM software, or if you’re just curious enough to try out new tech, send an email to:justin.kane@siemens.com","Bluechip Sounds great.

Turn off collision checking / holder avoidance. Get a good path shape then you can use tilt tool axis to fix collisions.

When I saw it correctly your Y-Axis look to the wrong direction in Main 0 , you should rotate 180°. You should never have a rotation in G53 and all other zero points, if you need a rotation you should use KSYS rotation after a Fixture offset. To avoid this problem it´s easier to load the machine first and mount machine zero to MCS zero. If you still have the problem you have to check your machine zero in the machine_base  dtziatzios(Partner) Hi Steffen,  Thanks for your comment too.  I don't think the direction of the Y axis is such a crucial issue for this synchronization error.

In the samples of machines there is also no such situation.Using only the AC head I can simulate and compensate the A and C axes in the kinematics:As you can see in the image, I only have ""X,Y,Z+A,C"" in my right kinematic chain.But when I try to use ""X,Y,Z,B+A,C"" the following error occurs:If someone could teach me how to solve it, I would be very grateful!@ThomasF​@Thomas_S​","Study I think there is no chain solution for 3 rotaries. This is probably because inverse kinematics would need rules like robot programming because of multiple solutions. It would be easy enough for math to figure out where to put the machine axes so that the tool tip is correct when explicit programming of 3 rotaries but the problem is with vector programming (inverse kinematics.) I would look at using ""getHeadCorrection"" unless TRAORI or G43.4 or tcp function handles a 6 axis transformation on the machine. I would follow what is done on the control to handle it. If Siemens control - TCARR probably is used for the head and probably no comp used for the table. It is also possible that the machine tool builder's software uses CYCLE800 to (in addition to comping head and tool) align the coordinate system with the spindle. Otherwise I would imagine you will have ROT's and TRANS's to do (or use fixture offset rotations.) I would figure out what the machine applications people tell you is the program code and then implement that in CSE the best way possible. A good first step is to have a program that will do what you need on the machine (maybe you do but don't mention.) My guess is that it will not implement 6 axis TRAORI. NowsfekyBR Hello ! Thank you for the explanation. In the case of the machine, the process proceeds by first calculating the rotation of the ""B"" axis table through a subroutine and recording the position in another zero point and after that, ROT and AROT are used with TRAORI for the AC head. I tried to explain as simple as possible.  I believe that through mathematics it is possible to do everything in the right CSE. But I would like to know if there is an easier way to implement this. Even because in the TNC640 using PLANE AXIAL the machine is able to use all 6 axes ""XYZ+ABC"". Study Ok. If you are seeking a 6 axis chain and using TNC I am not much help with either. My guess is as a programmer they will want to lock in one of the 4 90 degree directions because of the rectangular table (so big corner not causing need to reach across a lot of table.) For a 5 axis sequence I would try to find the best B for reach and use head axes for tcp in most cases. ||| NowsfekyBR Hello ! Thank you for the explanation.

The kinematic chain must not hold more than two rotary axes.

I hope that clarifies it a bit more  NowsfekyBR Ok, I got it. Could you just tell me how can I get this pre position in the CSE? Because from what I understand, I would have to make the simulator understand that the zero point was rotated along with the B-axis table and then use the AC current for correct correction. ||| NowsfekyBR Ok, I got it.

How does the NC Code look like and which is the behavior of the ocntroller.

If you create the NC code in a specific location it is not done automatically. The default location for NC code and shop documentation files is the export folder, so we would need to know, if your PP moves the files somewhere else. ||| JasonOtto Hello-  There are some conditions on how this works. If you have NX manufacturing integration set up properly and you are running in a ""library"" type of cam configuration and you are using the master model concept that you asked about in your other post, the results will be as follows.  When you create the CAM setup, it will be its own MENCMachining item in TC, with its own prt file, where the design item is pulled in as a component of the cam assembly. When you save this cam item to TC, the software will automatically import the extra files from the session, including the tool info, posted code file, shop docs, etc and place them in an Activities folder under the MENCMachining dataset.  In the example below, you can see that we started with a CAD model that is item 000527. Then, we created a new cam setup as item 000528, which is the MENCMachining item type, and that it references the 000527 model for its assembly component. In the setup, I post processed the program group named ""1234"" that has an operation using tool named ""MILL_1"" using the post named ""mill_3_axis"" and the resulting code file and tool data is in the Activities folder. ﻿  This does create an additional unique, but related, item for the manufacturing files in TC, rather than piling everything under a single part number and trying to put all the data into big UGMaster prt file. The advantage is that you get to have all the extra data automatically stored in TC in a specific manufacturing dataset structure and keep the design side isolated from the manufacturing side. In the cam setup assembly, the design model is only referenced. Others have already commented on the general benefits of the master model approach, and all the same holds for the TC environment, with the added ability to have the supporting files automatically imported and placed in the setup dataset.  Of course, there is a lot that goes into getting this all configured correctly, so I would recommend your local reseller or Siemens rep help out your site directly. There are a couple workflows and library scenarios possible to use this method, and you would want to look at all the options available and have your process mapped out to get everything right.  Hope that helps! ||| Enix Hi@JasonOtto​ , Thank for your quick response. It was very helpful. Sure I'll contact Siemens regarding this."

I dont think theres a special cycle however ill check with DMG, Thanks. ||| Ken_A Tiberius14AD - You need to start with the machine - how does the machine handle this? G Codes? M codes? how do they handle the eccentricity in the cross section? what kinds of non-circular cross sections do they support? (ellipse? polygon? others?) how do they handle the off-center specification (e.g. turning a circular cross section where the centerline of the section is not the spindle centerline - e.g. a crankshaft)?  Note if you let NX create the spun section, it will be to the MAXIMUM material. ||| Tiberius14AD Hi Ken  I would assume it handles with G Codes but ill need to check with DMG, the machine we have is a DMG NTX1000. Regarding the spun section we ran into that problem, i thought we may be able to use a milling toolpath using the model geometry as a drive method with a staionary tool, i was hoping NX would have a custom toolpath for this type of application but im not sure its going to be that easy. Regards Chris. ||| Ken_A I know some machines have codes to do off-center turning (although I believe they still require a circular cross section, just that the centerline doesn't match the turning spindle centerline)  If it is a non-circular cross section, you will probably need to program it like a mill operation with the ""live tool"" spindle locked (not turning), and the turning spindle = C axis ||| Tiberius14AD Yeah, im pretty sure this is the way ill try to do it.

All machining rules should have a condition like this:  oper.PROGRAM_ORDER_GROUP = ""X_"" + ToString(mwf.X_ORIENTATION_D,2) + ""Y_"" + ToString(mwf.Y_ORIENTATION_D,2) + ""Z_"" + ToString(mwf.Z_ORIENTATION_D,2)  [note: by default the string representation of a double has 4 decimal places. Limiting here to 2 decimal places just for example]  In the upcoming release NX2312 a known issue #10747796 is fixed : when 2 features are exactly the same - same type, same parameter values - and only differ in depth orientation, then one of them is solved and the other(s) are allocated to the same Feature Group and hence get the same Program Order Group. To work around this issue in the current released versions, use the Per Feature option or temporarily switch On the Early Access Feature named ClassicCreateFeatureProcess  ||| Stefan Pendl If you use ""per Feature"" every feature gets its own process. To get all similar features machined with the same set of operations, you need to use ""use existing"". To group the features by orientation, you have to manually group them before you create the machining process. You can select the access direction as the search criteria to add only features with the same orientation to the group. If you use the new create feature process introduced around NX 1980, you can create the machining process directly on the groups. ||| k-koga(Partner) Stefan and Reinier thank you for your valuable input.  The version I am currently verifying for FBM is NX2212. After further verification, I think that the current version is limited to the results shown in the picture. If I do the feature process for each machining feature one by one, I can get the desired result, but this is very tedious! I would look forward to the release of NX2312. Thanks to you guys for your help! ||| Stefan Pendl I would enable the classic ""Create Feature Process"" as Reinier said. We are currently migrating to NX 2212 and have major issues, when the new ""Create Feature Process"" is used. The classic ""Create Feature Process"" works for us as it has done since NX 8.5."

I can recognize some rule names 😎  To troubleshoot that, you will need to check what has changed from NX 12 to your current version.  Since that implementation is extensive, you will have to look in the constants, add ins and TCL functions.  Good luck! dennisP_146 i did some validity checks and solved some errors (probably due to migrating to FBM configurator) it still has some warnings but just used it on a simple threaded hole and is seems to work fine. Gonne have to do some more testing. The documentation form siemens helped a lot but its hard to get started with this when its already such a big library ;) Reinier Capelle Your colleague left the company but (some of) his know-how is in the machining rules 🙂 You may look into the Explanations tab to see if he wrote thoughts in there. Otherwise you will have to re-engineer by looking into the rule's conditions, see their priorities etcetera. ||| dennisP_146 i did some validity checks and solved some errors (probably due to migrating to FBM configurator) it still has some warnings but just used it on a simple threaded hole and is seems to work fine.

You need only have a DXF or DWG file of the shape, and on the ""Sheet"" tab, in the Create group, use the DXF/DWG button to import the file to use as your sheet stock. It has worked well for us.   ||| Ian1689891311582 Hi@SeanCresswell​ , sorry I may have tagged this incorrectly. I am referring to the NX 2D nesting tool, not the Solid Edge tool.

Our admin requested eval licenses for 2D nesting to be converted to full licenses if I can figure out whether the feature-set works for my application.  We deployed the eval licenses, and I was able to run nesting on NX 2007 with a square stock (of side lengthR). Right now I'm manually dragging a circle around in the sketcher after the nested 2D is generated to get a circumscribed circle. Dave Walker Fantastic.  yes Custom Stocks is available in 2206 as the demo shows.  Thanks  Dave Ian1689891311582 Great!  another question,@Dave Walker​ . The marketing pages for the 2D nesting software don't explain how this ""state of the art"" algorithm works, so it's hard to fully trust the results as 'optimized'. Does it use genetic learning algorithms? no-fit polygons? something else?  Notably, the nesting algorithm we've developed internally is considerably more efficient at packingone partacross an entire stock. Our algorithm opts for more regular patterns/spacings/placements of parts within the stock, whereas this Siemens algorithm appears not to be concerned with such regularity. As a result, a lot of space on the stock gets wasted on irregular part-to-part distances.  If I could learn more about how the algorithm works and what mathematical procures it's running, I can have more confidence in NX's 2D nesting as being the preeminent algorithm for my application.  Thanks Dave Walker Hi@Ian1689891311582​ , When we developed the product, we searched through available algorithms and even researched our own. Our conclusion was the one chosen was the most efficient. If you would like to share your data and criteria (through IR if confidential) I would be happy to run a few trials for you.  NX 2D Nesting has many options for fixing the rotation of parts however I believe parts are rotated if it saves space.  Have you experimented with extending the nesting time?  Try 60s, 120s, etc.  I cannot share the details of the algorithm and how it works, that is the IP of the algorithm provider.  thanks,  Dave ||| SeanCresswell Hi there@Ian1689891311582​.... all good.

Since you do not specify tool machining data the values are used for tools with a different number of flutes, not with a specific number of flutes. If you have a tool that uses the same machining data despite of the part material and the cut method, you can use the tool machining data tab, where the information is collected from the library tool directly.

https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O000086tTL7SAM/swoosh-part-revision-programming-video-questions,Swoosh Part Revision Programming Video Questions,"I was provided this video a while back regarding programming part families from customer supplied models.https://www.swooshtech.com/2020/06/05/replacement-assistant/I have a few questions, to hopefully speed up my programming on part families.In the video, this replacement was done from a linked body. Previous engineers where I work really have never used the master model concept and models are either imported directly into the file or added as a component (without a linked body). How is this replacement assistant method performed when parts are added to a manufacturing file as a component with no wave link? In contrast, how is the replacement assistant used when parts are directly imported into a manufacturing file? Towards the end of the video it was breifly mentioned but I still wanted to see if I could get some more detail regarding this. It almost seems like a manufacturing file needs to have been set up a specific way at its birth in order for this to work, which doesn't directly apply to me as I mentioned before, previous engineers have never really linked bodies in the past at my current employer.I tend to use curve drive toolpaths as those make the most sense to me and I struggle to get decent toolpaths when selecting geometry, like faces. When I tested the method shown in the video on one of my files, it seemed like the curve driven toolpaths did not transfer over to the new part, while the area/face selection toolpaths did. Do curve driven toolpaths work with this replacement method?Figuring this method out would save me a large chunk of time, hopefully, versus the current method that I use which is ""replace component"" and reconnecting every single toolpath across all part sizes which is very tedious. Thanks in advanced.","tobias_klein Hi Burnzy,   Burnzy I appreciate your response. If the CAM program was not created using a wave-link or extracted body BEFORE it was programmed, then I will not be able to use the replacement assistant correct? For example, it wouldnt work if the model was imported as a step file directly into the CAM file, had the toolpaths created from this model, then I extract geometry. This wouldn't particularly work as the extracted geometry wouldn't of been what was selected to program toolpaths. Is this all correct? tobias_klein Yes, that's correct. But if you need to replace the STEP file anyway because of a changed geometry, it might make sense to create a WAVE-Link of the new geometry and reference the linked geometry in your CAM operations. If you would have to replace the geometry again in the future, you could benefit in using the replacement assistant then Keith... We use Wave Links extensively in our modelling and CAM parts. To replace a wave link feature and fully map all surfaces and edges can become very time consuming especially if the source solid is a dumb model like a STEP solid. If the mapping is not 100% successful you will be back to re-selecting geometry anyway and the part must have changed to be replacing it so chances are that there will be topological changes. If the part is complex I find it quicker and easier to re-select geometry in CAM even if this is edges for PLANAR_MILL operations. So if you are not familiar with WAVE linking then this may be time consuming to explore.  If the operations you are using can be machined using Floor Wall operations that use surfaces instead of edges and curves, this maybe a better solution for you as there will be less geometry to select.  How complex are the parts that you are machining, what type of features do they commonly have?   Burnzy The complexity of our parts varies obviously, but I wouldn't say we do overly complex parts, though we have in the past. We do a lot of medical as well as aerospace work. We do a lot of unusual contouring with 3D surfacing, I try to use adaptive milling as much as possible, planar milling, and threadmilling.  Are you suggesting that re-mapping all of the toolpaths without using the replacement assistant is still the most efficient way for you? In my experience what I've done is open two copies of NX and have the ""old"" program on one monitor and the ""new"" (which is the old program save-as the new part numbers name, I then use ""replace component"" to swap out the models) program on another monitor that way I can compare what was selected vs what needs to be selected to produce the same toolpaths on a different size part. Is this more in line with what you would recommend vs replacement assistant?  We also almost exclusively work with dumb models, like STEP files, provided from our customers. I struggle to get the area selection driven toolpaths to produce quality toolpaths so I've gravitated to mostly curve driven toolpaths for anything other than surface milling. Burnzy Say I make a wave-linked part and set that as my main geometry as my part. If I'm having difficulty creating a toolpath because of certain features on that wave-linked finish part, would I extract the geometry of the wave-link so I can delete some of the features that are restricting a decent toolpath being made? When I do this, NX won't give me a toolpath because I'm selecting surfaces from the extracted body, which is not what my workpiece is set to.

When a TCPM mode should be implemented check the CSE commands SetKinematicTransformation and SetInterpolationMode, these are the action which are used in the standard implementation. Both should give full flexibility to get the desired behavior. Try the parameter of the second methods like to achieve different behavior.

Any idea?  ||| Thomas_S Hello Iván,  in case you interested in simulate these option: FUNCTION TCPM AXIS SPAT  When setting the kinematic transformation with a chain it can handle two ways to get the tool vector.  To apply the SPAT option the vector mode is suggested to be used. For each line collect the three values A B C (Spatial - rotations around a coordinate system) e.g. in the meta codes do nothing other as store the values in global variable in case of SPAT mode Afterwards in the GMe_HandleLineEndEvent use matrix calculation to get a tool vector based on the three rotaries (as it is done in PLANE SPATIAL too.) Having these values use SetNormalComponent for First, Second, Third Axis (like we do in TRAORI A3 B3 C3) That should do the trick  Hope this helps"

Operations created automatically by Create Feature Process are allocated under the same Method parent as they have in their operation template part. In your example screenshot that is a HOLE_MILLING operation from the hole_making.prt template where it is under MILL_METHOD. So, a MILL_METHOD with that exact name must be present in your CAM setup.  Indeed as Stefan pointed out, the oper.METHOD_GROUP can also be assigned in the rule's condition, which overrules the original parent name.  Create Feature Process does not create missing Method objects in your CAM setup. If the method is not there, the operation will be placed under Unused items. "

Hole milling (with an end mill, not a drilling operation) has the ability to set axial cut levels, but I see no option to retract the tool between them. This would be beneficial for clearing out chips.As far as I can tell, without a retract, the levels function serves no purpose unless you are doing a circular or spiral pass. It has no benefit to helical boring.As with everything in NX, I wonder if I am missing a feature box somewhere, or is this just not an upfront option?","Juraj(Partner) I think there is no such option. Only transfer/rapid settings between features. ||| RL Hi, I couldn't find any settings in Hole Milling either. Have you considered using a Generic Feature Operation? This is a fairly new operation type that allows the user to create a custom Hole Making cycle. When this operation is added to a Hole Making Feature Group it preforms the motion at every location.  You, also, may want to consider creating an Enhancement Request to add the retract. Juraj(Partner) GFO, yes, this could do good job. Once I created routine which contains - drilling, thread milling and chamfer milling (ofcourse you need proper tool ). And with a little bit effort you can make nc cycle output of it.

GFO can definitely help here. ||| ToonVDK Hi Gkoenig,  You're right we currently do not support a full retract outof the hole in between axial levels for hole milling.  For helical boring in full material with only a single radial pass the existence of multiple axial levels will probably have less/no* value. (* I am not sure if in some cases a retract and re-engage at levels might have a positive impact on chip breaking)  I assume though that most will use a standard machine cycle in most of these cases? If yes, one can switch to hole milling canned cycle paths and rely on the machine cycle to have chip removal (if available).  Nevertheless this could be a nice enhancement to the current hole milling operation, specifying a lift to a clearance above hole top (deep/chip removal) and/or just a retract with height for intermediate retracts similar/same as final retract (breakchip/chip breakage).  With reference to other remarks, with GFO -as suggested by Randall and supported by Juraj- one can specify this desired manual cut pattern once and apply this on multiple holes easily (with or without adaption in the post to map this to a machine cycle as per Juraj's suggestion).  Thanks,  Toon gkoenig Re: Standard machine cycle for helical boring with a milling tool is not exactly widely available on most machine tools. Most canned cycles are for drilling, and NX already has extensive options for total control.  Whenever doing low-volume work, we wind up milling a lot of holes just to avoid having to have precise drill sizes on hand. It works perfectly well, but chip removal with helical boring is always an issue. I was curious as to why NX provided a function to specify cut depths, but doesn't seem to be doing anything with it when using the helical cut option.

The toolpaths that I see crashes on are not full 5 axis milling, but a rotation to a position where a toolpath runs, then transitions to the next toolpath after another rotation. Within NX I see the start of a toolpath, the toolpath itself, and the end of the toolpath which is essentially all in one vector. Is there any optimal way in NX to ensure the transition from one toolpath to the next will not hit any fixturing?","Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) The machine motion between operations is handled by the post processor in all versions of NX except the latest, where the Transition Path is a new feature added to the software to handle this.  Typically, default post processor settings will cause the tool to retract along the axis until the home of that axis is reached, before changing work planes. This motion is customization in the post processor, so that is where you will want to address this unless you are using NX 2306 and can make use of the Transition Paths. ||| Juraj(Partner) Currently I recommend to use axis retact to furthest point (home) when there is a rotary positioning. But when we look into it a little bit deeper: Safe moves outputed by postprocesor or kinematic based transitions (also rule based blocks outputed by postprocesor) - can be home of the axis - time consuming but safest, some tcpm moves in some point or any other sequence. But you have no guarantee to not collide. Simulation can show collisions, but you dont have it. This is important fact. From my point of view, when you have no simulation - if operations would be connected with something like merge tool path - which is real generated tool path,collision checked and you see actual movement of the tool on tool path (!) - that would be the best solution. *Ofcourse for 5axis tcpm/3+2 (full) machines. Merge tool path / concatenation / currently handle some operation types and this could be the future. Till that moment I recommend to use axis retract to home when rotary repositioning occurs from one operation to another. ||| Steve Curtis Whenever there is a work coordinate change or a change of angle on our 4 axis machines, I retract home in Z, then move to the new work coordinate or angle of rotation. I set that up in our post. For our 5 axis machine, the controls automatically retract to limit along the current tool axis before positioning to the new position by use of a G code. ||| Burnzy Appreciate the responses everyone.

I want to be able to see the holder when I use verify as that is the only ""simulation"" I have the ability to use.I then ""create tool"" and model the insert accordingly to match the step file I've downloaded. I turn off holders and adapters so the tool I am creating is only the insert.I then turn on ""export tool part file"", set the mounting location, the insert tip location, as well as the cutting edge selector. I export tool to library and when I call that tool back up the holder is nowhere in sight. I've had this work intermittently with other tools, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't which just adds to the frustration. What am I doing wrong to get the model of the holder imported? NX turning tooling is disgusting and awful to work with.I've seen the turning tool best practice pdf off of post hub and quite frankly I think that is also terrible documentation. Can anyone help me understand how to create tools with imported holders in NX? Everytime I go to do this its a giant headache.Last time I posted about this, I contacted my NX reseller who had me on the phone for2 hourstrying to create tools with imported holders, only to get nowhere. Beyond frustrated at this point.","ThomasF Hi Burnzy,  I can fully understand your frustration and appreciate your frank words and feedback. It is also not nice to have to read that even with the support of a reseller you did not achieve the desired goal.  In your particular case I would like to better understand at which point you started stumbling and which requirements you have where you think that improves the process.  Out of the statement below I take the requirement that you want to have a parametric holder available besides the solid holder. ""I want to be able to see the holder when I use verify as that is the only ""simulation"" I have the ability to use."" This is currently not supported and not foreseen in the concept. Solid turning tools (inser+holder) work/require only a parametric insert without the holder. I hope that clarifies what you can expect.  In addition please keep in mind that in future version ""Verify"" gets retired. It has been already marked with legacy to indicate all users the retirement. This remark doesn´t change your requirement. I just want to make sure that a change in a workflow will come.  You also said that the documentation on Posthub didn´t helped you. You referring to the PDF only. Keep in mind there is also a video and template files to make the workflow more intuitive.  Hope the quick response indicates that we take your feedback serious and that we have a interest to turn your frustration into minimum 'met your expectation'. .. the happiness comes after ;-)  Thanks ThomasF Burnzy Appreciate the quick response.  I'm a little confused by what you're saying when you say ""Solid turning tools (inser+holder) work/require only a parametric insert without the holder.""  I'm essentially looking to have a solid tool holder (not parametric), I've altered the parameters for the insert without the holder and my thought was using ""export tool part file"" was adding the non-parametric holder to the tool within my library. Are you saying this is supposed to work or that its not supported? As an example of what I'm after, I've attached a screenshot of one of the tools that this has worked on. All I did for this tool was input the insert dimensions and export the part file data in a seperate file with the tool holder step file in it. This method works when it wants to and I see no difference of how I perform this when it works vs when it doesn't.Without the holder being modeled I would need to look the holder up and browse for the clearance numbers for how deep I can cutoff before I shank out. With the holder modeled, my clearance distances are obvious. This is my main goal, to have accurate inserts/holders that allow me to see clearances and when tools need to be modified.  Just to add some context to my frustation: One of our tooling vendors is Harvey. Harvey has an entire library of over 30,000 tools that can be imported into a bunch of major CAD/CAM software, besides NX.

Stefan Pendl Adaptive milling also started out with only supporting regular end mills, afterwards bull-nose mills where added. Due to NX 2212 including the initial phase of 3D adaptive roughing only the regular end mills are supported. So all this is guesswork since I do not have any information about how 3D adaptive roughing was developed. Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) @CAMster​ That is a fortunate position to be in. The most productive way to share the demand you have with the development team is to submit an ER through the support site. If you haven't already, please do that as it will help get the capability you are seeking implemented sooner. ||| Stefan Pendl Siemens NX has released operations with all the bells and whistles in the past, but then the operation was not usable at all. Now they release operations in phases, with the minimum support to start with, this makes sure things are working reliably before additional tool types are supported. ||| Eric Magray(Siemens Employee) It takes a lot of time and effort from skilled people to create useful and reliable software. I am sure you are well aware of the expectation people from company departments outside of manufacturing have - that parts can be made by simply uploading a file to a machine and pressing the green button. Your venting about suffering through software releases implies your expectations around software which reliably generates correct tool path data for all use cases may be similar to the expectation of part manufacturing being a simple button-push away.  It's easy to have high expectations when you are far enough removed from the actual work involved. Just remember this is true for all sorts of complex problem-solving work, including software development. ||| CAMster I am fortunate enough to work for people that understand that it is not as simple as load the program and push the button. We work on components that are worth 50K+ before we cut a chip.

In general the tool path is always generated on the original geometry, the mirrored geometry is just need for tool path verify and gouge checking. Marek2211 Hello, Its Build 8900. I understand its generated on original geometry but the issue is the path is not transfered then to mirrored geometry.  As you can see on this photo, the path has status mirrored but is on original geometry Stefan Pendl Is there anything written to the NX log file that gives a hint about what had happened? We currently on NX 1980th series and in rare cases the operation does not end up in the expected geometry, restarting NX is currently the only solution. Marek2211 No there is nothing about any failure during mirroring. For us is also the only solution restarting NX and this issue happens randomly and its not replicable. Sometimes its mirror all operations but as i said the toolpath is not transfered. Sometimes it doesnt even generate all operations.

However, in the ‘Fixed Contour’ 3D strategy, after I checked it, I found that the tool position points in the tool path became dense and the tool path seemed to have no other changes. Can I use it as an ‘increase tool position points’ option? Will there be any ‘side effects’, such as changes in the tool path?","RL The Output Contact Data option is used for 3D Cutter compensation. You need to output only linear moves and turn on CUTCOM/LEFT in the operation. The post will need to be configured. Yc_Hu Yes, I understand that it is used for 3D tool compensation. I am curious, if I check this option but do not make changes in the post-processing, will the final tool path change? On the surface, is it just that the tool position points become dense and the overall tool path does not change? ||| Yc_Hu Yes, I understand that it is used for 3D tool compensation.

In other situations you should not rely on them having the correct value. I would always use M140 MB, either with MAX or with a value, see the Heidenhain controller manual for information. ||| Thomas_S Hello Gustavocal2987  In the CSE at any time you can request the values of any axis by using getJointValue(""B""). By using a variable method it will be possible to return e.g. the B axis value when the TNC Variable is used.  I hope I understand you request and this is helpful.  ||| gustavoacl2987 you are right Stephan Q121 works only in the cases i used Plane Spatial (3+2 thool path) in the others situation (5 multiaxis) in which Plane Spatial is not defined Q121 is set to 0º while the tool is in B=-15. ||| Stefan Pendl There is a system parameter that contains the current values of the axis, you can read that and branch accordingly, see the Heidenhain manual on the topic SYSREAD for the table. ||| gustavoacl2987 Ok, NX can´t read that system parameter in CSE simulation, but i think that the NC code in the machine will run ok. I´ll try next week Thnks ||| Thomas_S Hello,  let me clarify. Inside the NC code based simulation we can cover and handling variables as well as provide current position of axis.  Can you please add asmall piece of NC codeas an example and explain on which block youexpect what behavior? I am pretty sure when knowing that I could explain how to make it happen. ||| Stefan Pendl I think the OP means something along the following: This will return the current nominal position of the B axis in the active coordinate system including offsets. ||| Thomas_S Addition:  Make sure the axis number of axis B is 5 Here what is implemented OOTB for SYSREAD    ||| gustavoacl2987 Hello. Thanks for the replies First of all, im not using PostConfigurator, the post is made with post-builder. Securely thas why the cse simulation dont read properly the B axis value.  Today i runned the nc code as is leave NX from our post on a Heidenhain iTNC Workstation and works perfectly, in fact, is works and simulates as it simulates on the real machine (DMU 75 V linear with Heidenhain 530 control).  The first part of the code is this...We use the LBL 171 subroutine to start and finish every opetarion, specialy 3+2 and 5 axis. But we would like to jump the M140 MB MAX for every case in which the B axis is vertical oriented. ||| Thomas_S Hello,  do I understand it correctly? The CSE Simulation works as it should be? SYSREAD 240 1 5 will read the current value of the B axis into the Q21 variable and in case the value is 0 it jumps over and skip line 15. That is what is expected and it works.  Is the value of Q21 are different on different operation as expected?

Here is the code I need to skip (&F=/USER/PATH1/).  This is a dual channel machine and I have not been successful with using mom_post_in_simulation to make this a comment.  After some reading it seems you have to use mom_postprocessing_mode.  I have been able to use it successfully so that in sync manager I do not get the &F and posting from sync manager I now get my &F.  However, I'd rather use the simulation task environment vs sync manger for simulating both channels.  So it seems the best place is to tell the parser to skip this line.  What I believe I need to do is to modify the CseFanuc_Tokens.json file and place this modified file inside the cse_driver folder of the installed machine folder but I am having trouble understanding what token to modify and how.

Sure, you can add/remove/replace parts from an assembly that is linked to NX, but you'll still have to re-specify the work part in NX. Wave linker is the NX tool that will (to some extent) automatically link features on parts that have changed or been swapped. There are some good videos on YT. ||| Anton Persson Hi@MALJ​  For just the PART assignment in the workpiece you can create either your own templates file to use an Wave geometry linker(Linked body) and assign the linked body as PART in Workpiece. Then if you do replace component on your Part you will just have to ensure the linked body is assigned to the new part.  Or you can download already prepared template files in the upcoming weeks. Sometime in the next weeks (~w23) there will be new setup templates available on Posthub that is using this workflow, the templates also contains a simplified 2d machine that can be used as reference & part alignment also prepared geometry structure with preloaded operations & Tools.
